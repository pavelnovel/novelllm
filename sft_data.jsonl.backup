It is really a... lapse into taking one's self gravely, because it is the easiest thing to do... For solemnity flows out of men naturally; but laughter is a leap. It is easy to be heavy: hard to be light. Satan fell by the force of gravity.\" Take yourself lightly. There's a sense of a playful, Zen-like detachment in this.

{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "I got GPT-4 to give me the greatest answer for what is marketing. Backstory: I asked GPT-4 to make up a language. It made one up called Introspectia. First, I asked G what the word for \"marketing\" is in this language, along with the etymology. G answered with the following: \"In the Introspectia language, \"reskivalia sumbanit\" represents the concept of marketing. The etymology of this compound term is as follows: \"reskivalia\" - a combination of \"reski,\" which means \"to communicate\" or \"to convey,\" and \"valia,\" meaning \"value\" or \"importance.\" The word \"reskivalia\" highlights the aspect of marketing that involves communicating the value of products or services to potential customers. \"sumbanit\" - derived from \"sumba,\" which signifies \"exchange\" or \"interaction,\" and \"nit,\" meaning \"network\" or \"web.\" The term \"sumbanit\" captures the interconnectedness of marketing activities and the various interactions between businesses and consumers. Together, \"reskivalia sumbanit\" encapsulates the essence of marketing as the communication of value within a complex network of exchanges and interactions. This compound term demonstrates Introspectia's capacity to express intricate concepts, reflecting the language's focus on articulating one's inner experiences and societal phenomena.\" Now that I got G thinking outside of the box, I then asked it to describe the role of marketing within society using Introspectia, along with the translation. This was the poetry that G came back with: Marketing (reskivalia sumbanit), a powerful tool for shaping perceptions (holvanax zentori pluvarin), plays a significant role in our society (burqelmo retinat fiklorem). It influences not only consumer behavior (tranqalio merkantia) but also the emotional landscape (skuvrati entelnoi), steering the collective desires and aspirations (ezarpo kranexi fostujar yubriat). When used responsibly (selnori duxari), it can foster growth and progress (vaskalmo greforia), weaving the tapestry of shared human experiences (simbratia enarit quntorin).\" That last part really hit. Chef's kiss. One more time, with emphasis mine: \"It influences not only consumer behavior but also the EMOTIONAL LANDSCAPE, steering the COLLECTIVE DESIRES and aspirations. When used responsibly, it can foster growth and progress, WEAVING THE TAPESTRY OF SHARED HUMAN EXPERIENCE.\" David Oglivy could never."}

(IRL is the new status symbol. Look for more brands creating and emphasizing IRL experiences.) We are almost returning to some Enlightenment ideals, where the value of a human is simply because they are human and are imbued with the soul and all that stuff they wrote about. We’re returning to this inherent and essential (as in essence) VALUE of humans. The knowledge that a piece of art came from a human will beat a “technically” superior, yet artificial piece, of art. Is that logical? No, but appreciation and connection to art, beauty, and humanity has never been about logic."}
{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "Crowds attract crowds. If you want people, go to where the people are, because other people will go there. Network effects, gravity, Pareto distribution; the names are different, but they're just different angles of the same things. If crowds attract crowds, go where the crowds are. Conferences, meetups, summits, panels, talks, performances. See who those places invite to come, because they know those people are magnets who also bring others. Magnets magnetize metals, so if you keep hanging around long enough, showing up, you get some magnetics too. But to underscore that, you have to go to where the people are. Making an organized effort to do that, and figure out what that means. It will definitely involve investing time and/or money. You can't skip that step, of going where the people are. A good place to start building a pipeline is to star at the source. Build little tributaries at multiple sources. It pulls and pools together. Have people and have systems and have tools that help build these magnets and tributaries. This takes the form of 3 forces: 1. communication, 2. community, and, 3. commerce. They relate to our human need to talk, gather, and share/exchange. If you're talking gatherings, you of course need the commerce, somehow someway, because any place needs some infrastructure. Any event needs a venue and every venue has a fee. An interconnected web of these three force (Communication, community, and commerce) encompasses so many departments, disciplines, and industries. Salespeople, influencers, event coordinators, strategists, freelancers, writers, photographers, entrepreneurs, PR agencies, data analytics people, web developers, influencer talent managers, GTM teams and RevOps and MarkOps teams. Trillions of dollars and billions of hours every year going to moving that triangle around. The triangle moves all by itself. The question then becomes: how to tap into the forces to move your business through your industry. Because the \"repositioning\" of a company within the industry - the mental map that anyone with the knowledge to be in that space - requires energy (time and money). How do you move a mountain? Stone by stone. How do you move a mind? Message by message, person by person, transaction by transaction. Communciation, Commuinty, and Commerce. It's not \"easy\" to move a company across the landscape. It takes time too. It does require work. Which is why you want to find and leverage any external focrces that you can in moving your company. Catch any wind you can. If there's a bustling community around a certain influencer in your industry, tap in. Work with local meetups, hackathons, fundraisers, or workshops. Participate in industry award programs. The forces are always out there, the winds are already blowing. The job is to raise the right sail at the right time. The most successful companies don't create movements from scratch; they identify existing people, places, and things work with them."}

My big problem is the word 'only' in \"...only what's wrong about the buyer.\" Thoroughly understanding what's wrong with the buyer—their daily lives, challenges, and pain points—IS central to effective marketing. To actually say the right things about the product requires knowing what's wrong in the lives and work of people using it. Marketing is a dynamic dialogue between the product and the market. Achieving product-market fit requires a deep understanding of the buyer's challenges (often unspoken and unidentified). These insights can come from anywhere, from a founder's intuition to rigorous data-driven methods like A/B testing. Once you understand what's \"wrong\" with the buyer, you begin to understand the product's value in a tangible, real way. Now, communicating the fact that you have the solution is a whole other game. This is where the art of copywriting and positioning comes in (a vital auxiliary skill for anyone involved in driving revenue and go-to-market strategies). But that's for another post."}

Why should you get good at taking breaks? You give your mind time to digest and ferment the snippets of thought into a thread that can provide a lot value. Step away from a screen and allow thoughts to wander, to return to our work with renewed energy, fresh perspectives, a Have you ever wondered why shower thoughts are so common? I guess it'd be because when we're in the shower, our minds KNOW that we can't or won't be able to do any work-related tasks. No notifications can come in, and no thought can be easily captured or acted upon. Our brain surrenders into just letting the thoughts pass over us, with ideas and mental alerts (reminders that pop up in our minds) washing through like the water. It's like a force meditation. And from a lighter mental state, new thoughts can break free when we loosen our tightened minds. When to take intentional, regular breaks? Lunch is an easy, regualr time to bake a break into.

Quick notes on Projects: - allows deeper collaboration by creating a self-contained workspace for specific projects (as the name implies). - each Project has individual chat histories, custom instructions, and knowledge bases, and allows for uploading additional doc to provide extra context - if you have the Team plan, you can invite specific members to collaborate on the project and have them share their own docs and knowledge bases. One way I'm thinking about Projects' use case is similar to how I'd make a Slack channel for a specific project, add all the relevant docs, and have conversations around that project. This is a BIG step towards making AI more collaborative and focused on day-to-day work. For example, say you have an upcoming project launch. You can have a Project around that where you have information related to the product. You can have separate chats about writing out the press release, some of the messaging for the product, and coming up with a media plan for the media buying team. After the launch, you can use this project to analyze all the data, organize and summarize all the customer feedback, and create a doc that you use with your team for review.

For fifteen years, I've tracked, measured, and optimized impressions as a KPI. Email impressions, social impressions, A/B tested for creative and copy, and copied the results into templated decks. Impressions became a standard unit of measurement. But I've been thinking about what an impression really is. The word itself comes from the physical act of pressing into something, much like ancient writing tablets, leaving a lasting mark that contains a meaning. Think about the social dimension of impressions. Think back to the last time someone truly left an impression on you. Perhaps it was someone at a conference, or at a friend's party. They left a particularly strong impression, for whatever reason. Maybe their outfit stood out, or something about their point of view struck you, or something they said, or the way they laughed. Now contrast that with being counted as an \"impression\" on someone's marketing dashboard, with barely a half-second scroll past content. What impression does that make? Almost none. What's fascinating is how genuine impressions often come from authentic expression. Consider the times when people left impressions on you. There's usually some element of their expression that stood out. And specifically, it's those elements that left their impression on you. Sometimes looking at familiar words with fresh eyes reveals their forgotten depth. Are we counting moments that truly leave a mark, or just collecting vanity metrics? The irony isn't lost on me that we chose such a meaningful word to describe such a shallow measurement."}

My mind always returns to the quote commonly attributed to Jerry Seinfeld, about writing a joke and never breaking the chain. It's digestible, but it's short-singed. I've over-applied them to myself, not realizing they don't suffice every person the same way. Much like one, same workout routine or exercise doesn't apply at maximum to all persons.

Usually, when people talk about marketing they've done, it seems that people initially approach marketing only through the lens of advertising/promotion. In reality, marketing (as a function & process) is a whooole lot bigger than just advertising. I help people recognize the depth of marketing because it'll unlock many new opportunities to differentiate their companies and reach people in a meaningful way. Everything from the product's price, the name & logo of the brand, colors used on the website, the words used in the Thank You emails, the photos selected, is part of marketing and is thus an OPPORTUNITY to differentiate. Remember the basics, the 5 Ps of marketing: Product, Price, Promotion, Place, & People. (and for context, Advertising is just one part of the Promotion-P). All of those elements present ways to do something unique. And that's just the start; marketing offers many more frameworks that can add perspectives to discover distinctions. However, you have first to recognize that opportunity to be proactive and intentional. You have first to be aware of that capacity to act & market in that way."}

[TL;DR- Short sentences and clear words build brands. Also, check the comments for my favorite free word-editing tool.] • phrases like \"next-level\" are too vague of adverbs to be compelling. If you're going to use adverbs, ensure they're powerful and push your sentence along • other cliches like \"start-to-finish\" don't add distinctions to the copy. If you see this in your writing, use it as an opportunity to elaborate on what the start and finish actually is. It can be as simple as adding one or two words. The extra descriptions show the reader that you know the process well enough to explain it. • words like \"nearby\" and \"local\" may be synonyms, but they convey different meanings. \"nearby\" communicates convenience; \"local\" expresses community. • sometimes, communicating a benefit can harm brand perception. You can assume certain benefits. An extreme example: I don't want poison in my bottled water.

The birth of a company marks a shift in perspective because now, unlike before, here exists a world in which your company, and its name, exists. The naming of something is a sacred divine rite. The naming of something and the saying of name is one of the roots around some of the various rules of religions against the depiction of figures. Depiction, or saying of name, desecrates it. The saying of something has power. Knowing the words, where singing a song or rapping along, is a powerful harmonizer and connecter. Something almost magical or sacred happens at that moment. Or when you see yourself in a certain uniform, sport, profession, or from your favorite band (or brand). Exhibition and habits, same etymological roots too. The uniform, masks, and lenses we put on determine how the world sees us and how we see the world, and considering both are reflections, those two things are one of the same. We put on icons that imbue us with powers of faith. Confidence. Icons. Luxury, athleticism, care. Bumper stickers, laptop stickers, logos. We can’t help but to reflect.

Not generalization for generalization's sake, but an intentional expansion of what's possible, not just not but in the future. The broader approach allows for unintended inspiration. It enables you to future-proof yourself. It also gives more relevancy to the specialized knowledge you already have.

What you probably haven't heard about (because it's a term I made up) is CRM Debt. But anyone in sales and marketing undoubtedly faced it. What is CRM Debt? CRM debt is the total cost of inefficiencies, data quality issues, and process breakdowns in a company's CRM because of neglect and poor maintenance over time. Like technical debt, it builds up gradually, causing problems over time. As a startup scales, its CRM becomes the central nervous system for sales and customer data. A healthy body needs a healthy system. So how does it happen? ◦ Rapid Data Entry—Contacts, leads, and opportunities grow quickly, usually without clear guidelines. ◦ Bloated Pipelines—Stages may not reflect actual sales processes. ◦ Deteriorating Data Quality—Duplicates and incomplete information become common. What's the cost of CRM Debt? ◦ Missed Opportunities—Poor data quality leads to lost sales chances. ◦ Wasted Time—Reps spend more time cleaning data than selling. ◦ Inaccurate Forecasting—Predicting sales becomes unreliable. ◦ Team Handoffs Break Down—Inefficient data sharing and process execution. What can be done? ◦ Clear Processes—Define and enforce data entry, lead qualification, and pipeline management from the start. ◦ Regular Data Cleansing—Deduplicate and cleanse data regularly. ◦ Optimize Pipelines—Align stages with the actual customer journey. ◦ Use Automation—Streamline data entry, lead routing, and task management where possible. ◦ Have a CRM Owner—Drives accountability for system health and maintenance. Some CRM debt is inevitable, so high-growth startups need to be proactive about CRM hygiene to support a high-performing sales machine."}

This is like the network effect, but for knowledge of you. I've been calling this the Knowledge Effect. A system (whether an algorithm or a model like an LLM) gets more value as the system gets more knowledge about the users and participants in that system. There's a learning multiplier that happens as more users use it over more time. Time is key here, though. Time can exponential growth, like when we visualize the power of compounding interest over 30+ years. Same here with the exponential jump in a system's knowledge of you and how much more relevant & helpful it can become. The longer the system gets used over time, the smarter it gets and the more helpful it becomes to you. This gap will especially be more glaring when in the future you try out an LLM that DOESN'T have the previous conversations. (Although there will probably be services that will let you transfer you previous conversations through the cloud to each other, basically like you're licensing your avatar. Like a reverse N64, you become the cartridge that gets plugged into the system.) Over years of a person using it, say in the year 2028, this assistant won't be just like 20% more helpful every year, but it'll be orders of magnitude, like 10,000%, more helpful (as judged by some magic metric of LLM helpfulness as a proxy for its value). At that point, it'll just \"feel\" like what was the promise of GenAI, and we will just move on and be preoccupied with looking for ways to arrange ourselves into different industries, companies, and associations. Basically, the humans will continue humaning. This makes the first-mover advantage with these persistent memory LLMs that much more valuable with the data they collect. Eventually, these models become data snowballs, much like Google and Facebook became data snowballs.

Hope and inspiration form the foundation for many compelling stories and campaigns. They're the refreshing antidote to the anxiety found in media today. Today, hope and inspiration will stand out and resonate more than ever. Less FOMO and more joy. ❺ Ignore competition ❺ I'm going to read fewer case studies, best practices, playbooks, etc. It sounds counter-intuitive, but constantly looking at what others are doing can stifle creativity. I can be a digital hoarder. Over the years, I've downloaded many resources, from checklists to ebooks. I've subscribed to so many marketing newsletters and listened to countless podcasts.

To rebuild our schedules with a more intentional focus on where our time and energy should be spent. The key was to facilitate more deep work sessions – times when we are fully absorbed and where productivity is at its peak. We changed some meetings to async sessions that'd use Looms and text. We batched calls into single days (client calls on Tues, internal check-ins on Wed, etc). Today, I'm glad to report that this restructuring has already shown a huge improvement (and a clear inbox!) I've been able to create more, contribute fully, and experience a sense of satisfaction I've missed in recent months.

There are regular answers about storytelling and creativity, but there's something more. The commercials have become an annual ritual that captures our imaginations and blur commerce & culture. The ads themselves begin to garner their own cultural capital. Commercials aren't just stories or entertainment. They're a glimpse into our society; they show what people are up to. Everyone is a consumer, you and I, and businesses (with all their suppliers). In a society dominated by consumption, the things we buy hold value. The collective gazing into ads is society looking at itself in a mirror, examining what we find important, and showing where the shifts are happening. And then, we talk about it because that is us processing this information. It's how we make meaning. And meaning-making isn't just the point of marketing, but of society as a whole. Times Square is another parallel. I've called it the Mecca of Commercialism. It's a place where people flock to. It's where people go to take and share photos of themselves in this place of advertisement because it is, in some ways, the center of where culture meets commerce—the center of it all. It's a marketplace of imagery, and we love imagery. We see ourselves in it. I've thought of other comparable collective rituals we have. Movie trailers came to mind, especially in the pre-Internet days when the only way to intentionally see the was before the movie started in a theater. You go to the movies to watch the trailers because it gives you a sense of what's coming up next. In many ways, that's what Super Bowl commercials are. They're a glimpse into the future. This role of foretellers harks back to the role that merchants of old have played historically. They were the ones who traveled to far-off lands and came back with stories and goods about what was out there and what was headed our way. The merchants were the ones who traveled into new spaces and got new ideas. And we, as marketers, continue that long tradition of voyaging into the future, foretelling what is coming."}

Viewers use this as an opportunity to see what we're up to, what the world is up to. What new technologies and products are being introduced? What cultural moments are happening?

It seems to understand the video content and also the content of whatever link is being shared. It then uses that content to craft custom questions and answers. I am only getting limited access (in their attempt to get me to upgrade to Premium), but I got some screenshots here. With LinkedIn being owned by Microsoft, it's no surprise that AI features are getting integrated on the platform. There's even an opportunity for LinkedIn to become a model of how social networks can integrate AI. My predictions: 1. We'll see some sort of LinkedIn bot for knowledge sharing. Maybe even a celebrity bot. (Imagine asking an AI Richard Branson bot questions about entrepreneurship) 2. We'll see a native integration of AI-generated comments (that's probably going to suck). 3. Some sort of AI matchmaking for lead generation in Sales Nav. Maybe my bot reaches out to your bot, and if it's a match, then the humans get introduced.

{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "Community is at the core of marketing. It's not individuals. The collection of people is what's necessary for this whole thing to work. Individuals in a larger context have interrelationships of values, ideals, and goals, and these become the grooves through which marketing can flow. Any factor regarding how something looks or makes a person feel emerges through this communal, collective conversation. When marketers talk about features vs. values, this is where the values come from. In other words, the value of something doesn't come from a vacuum, or an individual detached from the world. The community is what creates a sense of belonging and meaning. It opens up opportunities for growth (because growth only happens in relation to something else). It creates aspirations and heroes. Without this \"gap\" of what is vs. what could be, marketing as is won't work. Storytelling builds marketing, and these stories get us from one place to another. This place we're going to is guided on a path set by community. Also, \"community\" doesn't need to be a rigidly defined group with boundaries. It's not a list of your customers or sign-ups. It's not your social following. A community isn't static; instead, it's a dynamism that emerges from the combined interactions and interconnections among the group, always in flow. Marketing speaks within this framework. Effective marketing leverages this framework to build a beacon for the community to build around."}

What are the products in a capitalistic world that’s increasingly virtual and artificial? It’s personalized recommendations, feeds, playlists, and hyper-targeted interruptions. It’s the things that FB peddles to make their billions of dollars from advertising. FB is building a $1T company where the factories and labor are not only free, but aren’t aware that they’re those things. That’s important because 100 years ago, the consciousness you collectively had of being the factory workers at least allowed you to BELONG to this collective, you had collective power (via unions), and you weren’t alienated.

For easier quantification, dumping all customers into one bucket makes sense. The metric you look at is their lifetime value, measured only in their accumulated purchase currency. However, the value of customers goes beyond their purchase power. → One hundred customers living in the same building on the same block will offer more potential for growth than a hundred customers split across the country with no connection to each other. → A loyal customer who happens to be an up-and-coming local photographer has the additional ability to \"generate\" more value for the company. → A customer who's a customer because a close and knowledgeable friend raved about your brand has a different perception of your brand, one that positively spreads beyond your marketing department. These differences are negligible on a one-by-one basis. But aggregated, they create a massive shift in strategy. Over time, as these small dynamic customer factors accumulate, they compound to create a brand that seemingly grows on its own. The question then becomes, how do you design a marketing strategy that factors in these differences in the potential of customers beyond LTV? Just like the built environment influences individual behaviors (architecture, path-planning, etc.), a marketing strategy influences these individual behaviors where a customer's. These designs of marketing systems are invisible to customers (just like any good design). However, like any good design, they can all be intentionally planned, tested, and refined."}

Nature overtaking land is a natural process, and weeds themselves aren't inherently \"bad.\" You'd be surprised at how many plants that are considered weeds have medicinal and nutritional properties. However, it's just a matter of what you actually want with your land. (INTENTION) The weeds make it difficult to see the possibilities of the land and block your view. (CLARITY) Weeds aren't just a problem area for the place that has the weeds. Like all plants, they tend to spread, with roots growing under the ground that stifle other regions. They compete for space, water, and sunlight, and some weeds like vines can physically restrain shrubs and trees from growing. Speaking of roots, much of the weeds' growth that weeds comes from underneath, where you don't necessarily see them pop up until it's too late. They keep coming back, so you need to keep a constant eye on them. (MAINTENANCE) There are many metaphors here for business and life.

Anything you see on the Internet has been written, or photographed, or recorded by someone. And that someone is the creator. The billions of dollars that have been pledged to creators from dozens of companies sound like it's a lot. But it's a drop in the bucket of the supply chain of data and attention that has delivered trillions of dollars in value. The creator funds are a start though. The other thing to keep an eye on will be the allocation of all those funds. The determination of who gets it will almost always be guided by an overarching benefit back to the platform.

Now, what is the boundary of \"work\"? A separate room? A corner of the bedroom? Boundaries have different. Boundaries as an inter- and intra-personal concept is paramount today. We all partake in boundary-setting. With family, with friends, with clients, co-workers. Often, however, we're not aware or intentional about setting boundaries. And not setting any boundaries is in itself a form of boundary-setting. Setting boundaries with ourselves becomes even more crucial because that's how we recharge and redraw our strength and inner power to continue to serve and lead. Boundary setting can be as simple as maintaining even a quick morning routine and keeping a consistent cut-off time for when you're finished with work for the day. These time blocks will also help re-establish your home as a sanctuary for wholly enriching your life in different areas. By establishing boundaries (done with kindness and empathy towards others and self), we create the time/space that we need to be at our best."}

And almost in the same breath, new developments and trends showed otherwise. (This year, we're squarely in the LONG LIVE EMAIL! camp) Email will never die. The Internet now as we know it is not the Internet how it was conceived to be. Instead, the average user's experience of the Internet is mainly through a bubble of social media, guarded by monopolies and their algorithms. On the other hand, email operates over servers and protocols without a need for a company to control the flow of information. While there are a wide variety of mail client applications that allow you to interface with those servers and protocols, at the core of it, email is an open framework, very much unlike social media. Email is the closest regular experience people have of \"The Internet.\" The openness and decentralized nature of the email framework will always operate in tandem with walled gardens, which will inevitably pop up. (The profit motive is $trong) After all, you need an email address to make any account! Email and these walled communities are the heads and tails of the coin that is the Internet.

In addition to the SEO gains we're seeing on the B2B content side, our work on the B2C side with clients is also beginning to show results in Google. We're pulling Squirrels back into private beta as we build additional programmatic SEO features that let you programmatically create 100s of unique pages. We're also refining the content generation process, given all the recent improvements to current LLMs. Our constant human-in-the-loop, providing human expertise at every step, also helps with editing, fact-checking, and strategic alignment with the content. It's a fine line between complete AI control and a fully human-led process. It's also a fine line between focusing on building the product or pushing on the marketing.

Wearing my anthropologist hat, three things jumped out at me: 1. Relationship between Individual and Collective 2. Streaming and post-time 3. Lights flickering in a cave system . . . 1. I love how this video captures a scene of synchronized but uncoordinated collective ritual. It looks mesmerizing, like watching ocean waves come and go across a beach. Streaming a show at home is an individual act that can always become a Collective Act. Certain shows get qualified as a must-see, and we implicitly agree on giving them cultural symbolism. This process happens in real-time, and this video is an example of documenting this ritual. That's the magic of \"society,\" this supra-collective organism shaped in unison by seemingly separate, individual choices. This video shows a physically unique perspective of this merging between the Individual and Collective. 2. Cloud-based streaming, algorithmic timelines, and asynchronous messaging have shifted our relationship to time to what I've called a Post-Time Presence. However, time still has a firm grasp on us, being that we are human and inhabit physical bodies. We are still bound to physical rituals that become social connective tissues of a culture. These rituals give us unity and a sense of belonging. We do these rituals unwittingly, but for them to work, they must be done in real-time. There is a time for something. Timing becomes more valuable. In a world on a cloud, time becomes a stable structure that grounds us in the Now. 3. For thousands of years, humans gathered in caves and other solid earth abodes and put on shows for each other with lights, shadows, cave paintings, and acted stories. Now I see this concrete slab carved with modern caves, with the light flickering from the outside. We are still gathering in caves, playing with light. (h/t @bkillinit)"}

They help us determine: 1. Where we are 2. Where do we want to be 3.

{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "What does Elon Musk have to do with Netflix? The recent controversy with sharing Netflix passwords highlights the shift in our evolving relationship with content. From journalism to education, commerce, and politics, much of the last 20 years has been influenced by our access, interaction, and consumption of content. We no longer pay for ownership (defined by the physical form), and instead, we now pay for access to content and the experiences that come with it. It's not just the content itself; it's the convenience, timeliness, and curation of that content. The shows and movies themselves are just a part of the value. This raises the question, what do we consider to be ours in today's society? Is an account ours to share, in the same way we can share a book from our shelf? Who owns what? Not to overstate this framing, but this question of Ownership is a defining one, one which society is constantly asking and answering. (Remember, 175 years ago, a certain German duo asked about capital, labor, and ultimately ownership.) Absent from this debate, too, are the actual creators who are creating the content. While seemingly unrelated, four months ago, we were collectively debating the Ownership of Twitter and the expectations, responsibilities, and possible outcomes resulting from ownership there. Arguments were made around content visibility (free speech vs. censorship) and account access (banning and re-instating). This goes back to this evolving relationship to content, its access, and our expectations of platforms that mediate these relationships. Into this mix, I can also throw in the thorny perennial issue we've been dealing with surrounding privacy, tracking, and ownership of data about us. These aren't just social media or streaming platform questions. These are broad societal questions packaged with familiar logos and names."}

Looking at this 2011 list, very few had any subscription model. I sometimes forget how monumental the introduction and normalization of subscription models were. The shift from paying per song to paying for streaming a la Apple Music to Spotify's model. Ownership to access. The explosion of mobile led that shift.

{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "The interplay between creators and platforms runs deep. Platforms that help creators will have creators that help platforms. Most recently, the news that TikTok has overtaken YouTube in total watch time came as a surprising, yet almost inevitable, development. How did it happen? Much can be said about the recommendation algorithm and all the data that goes into it. My bet is that it had something to do with the ease of creation. Creating for YouTube is a hassle, compared to TikTok. Instagram didn’t just make it easy to post pictures. It made it easy to have your photos be shareworthy with the application of filters. TikTok did the same for videos. It allowed users with no video production skills to post shareworthy videos. Over time, having more and more content on the platform allowed the recommendation algorithm to become a competitive advantage. (With that said, that’s also how YouTube got big in the first place, with their barrier to creation between much lower than existing networks and platforms.) Now we are seeing a massive rise of creator funds from brands and tech giants, which are just extensions of the same creator-first ethos: help creators to help the platform.

{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "The creator class is the new working class. This isn’t a comparison of the types of work, but a similarity between them in how the two classes emerged within their new economies. The working class mainly emerged with the Industrialization of the economy. A collective consciousness took root, which resulted in clashes and upheavals against the larger systems of the organization of labor (factories, monopolies, companies, etc.). Much of it I’m simplifying, but Engels and Marx go more in-depth with it. Today, there’s a burgeoning collective consciousness of being a creator within the Internetization of the economy. Similar upheavals are happening, with a widespread emergence of unions for freelance writers, influencers, and other creators. Also, we are seeing collective resistance and creator boycotts (which have their own root as a class against a larger system of harassment and discrimination). There’s a common thread of pushback against the exploitation of labor/creativity, monopolization of platforms/profits, and collective organization as resistance. The other interesting parallel is that there had to be laws against child labor, barring children from working in mines and factories. Today, especially with recent leaks about the psychological effects on teens, we see a similar pushback against Facebook and their efforts to introduce Instagram for Kids. Do we need to update our child labor laws? Funny how the more things change, the more they stay the same."}

I love how media/marketing people borrow phrases from other disciplines in describing concepts. And \"going viral\" is one of the most popular phrases thrown around in the last decade. As marketers, we usually want things to go viral (for the right reasons, of course). But the actual mechanism of virality is a lot more nuanced. The way that viral or exponential growth operates is that it explodes after a seemingly slow period of growth. That second part is important. Business leaders always focus on the explosion rather than the slow growth. However, the slow growth part is necessary for the boom to happen. I also hear it when people talk about \"hockey stick growth.\" It compares the growth to the blade part at the end of a hockey stick because that's where all the excitement happens. But the only reason that analogy even works is that you have a much larger part that's straight until the very end. And you need both parts to have the hockey stick. That initial period is dull, unexciting, and mainly about consistency. And that's what makes it hard to do. But you gotta do it!

It's surprisingly easy to make marketing a race to the bottom. The classic example in business of this is an endless price-based competition, where competitors keep trying to undercut each other’s profit until profit margins dwindle and sustainable growth disappears for everyone involved. There are other examples that happen too often: Over-relying on discounts and promotions. Businesses may rely too much on discounts and promotions to drive sales, creating a culture of customer expectation for low prices, potentially reducing customer loyalty, and undermining the value of the product. (Remember, price can be a strong signal of value.) Blindly optimizing for lower cost-per-anything (clicks, acquisitions, etc.). If the quality of the click or acquisition is ignored, guess what? You’re racing to the bottom against the algorithm Under-investing in creative. This may mean trying to get cheaper visuals for ads, not getting enough images for a website, or using basic stock videos. If you’re planning to spend 50k in ads, it’s well worth investing at least 20% of that into high-quality creative that will help differentiate the business against competitors. The money “saved” on creative will undermine the whole marketing. Under-investing in promotion. If you’re planning to do an event, are running a big giveaway, or are paying professionals to do creative, make sure you’re also investing in advertising. It’s disheartening to see brands spend $$$ on great video, only for it to go nowhere. Remember, you and your business are playing the long game. Avoid becoming a commodity. Don’t race to the bottom. Getting to the top involves investing energy and money into differentiating your business. Build those profit margins. Grow that market share. Build customer loyalty and make your customers feel like they made the wise decision."}

Every craft needs a grind to sharpen its axe, and marketing has plenty of axes. After all, it helps to have plenty of good tools to take down a big tree, especially in the B2B space. We've found that having a clear systems approach to marketing and sales is that sharp axe. Good MarkOps helps with: 1. Investing in the right tools and technology. Marketers need the right tools to streamline their processes and make data-driven decisions. Marketing operations involves identifying (and implementing) the best software solutions for your team's needs, whether it's a CRM, marketing automation platform, or analytics tool. 2. Aligning marketing with sales and other departments. Marketing operations isn't just about making the marketing team more efficient. It's also making sure that marketing efforts are in sync with sales, product development, and other key functions. 3. Iterating and improving with feedback loops. Systems don't function in snapshots. It's an ongoing process that needs continuous optimization and iterating. Knowing what to iterate and what to look for as feedback is valuable. 4. Reducing waste. Discover what doesn't need doing. Think of Peter Drucker when he said: \"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.\" Streamlined operations help identify the crucial workflows so you can nix everything else and focus. The fruits of a sound marketing system are many, from having sales/marketing alignment to having a hassle-free reporting process. The roots are operations, and companies will need deep roots to grow tall."}

I love reading on that because network effects are fundamentally systems in action. Systems inspire me. Systems are how nature works, from our bodies to the planet. Somewhere in-between are companies and startups. It's fascinating to think about how systems work. For example, how the overall system affects one part, which in turn creates an effect that influencers the overall system, which then influences all the parts, forever onwards. These things are constantly in flux, and it's systems within systems. Turtles all the way down. Your supply chain, customer community, and social media platforms are all systems within systems, all interacting in imprecise and minute ways. The whole thing can be so mind-boggling to think about if you consider all the layers. That is why thinking in systems is such a competitive advantage. It helps bring to life why network effects, community, and partnerships are so powerful and how they will continue to impact everything from product design to marketing to hiring. There's no facet of business that's outside a system. Designing and operating within a system helps be adaptable and flexible and helps uncover new opportunities.

And many of these investors & VCs judge these companies on the nominal customer growth and acquisition. As a result, these companies work to acquire as many new customers at the lowest costs to woo investors, especially right before seeking the investment, without much thought to where they're coming from or the long-term relationships with these customers.

On a more macro scale, this also creates a cycle of VCs investing in startups that don't have much of a marketing strategy beyond customer acquisition, which over time puts those VCs in the same predicament of churn. What are you doing to break the cycle?"}

Ever since I read Jane McGonigal's gamification all those years ago, I've been on the lookout for the power of gamification elements in our mediated digital interactions. Reading this article sparked ideas of how closely linked gamification and attention are. Here, games don't only refer to common conceptions of games like console/PC games (think Call of Duty or The Sims), but all sorts of games we engage. Think of all the attention shows like Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune garnered. All the commercials during those breaks. Speaking of commercials and games, don't forget to include the Super Bowl, which has the largest attention share of anything ever. We make games about games (fantasy football). We have communities and groups and influencers and shows talking about games. We make reality TV about games. In the last decade, some of the biggest cultural phenomena were Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, Avengers Endgame, and Squid Game. Selective picking, I know, but there's a theme. There have been plenty of huge acquisitions of game companies over the last few years. Netflix and Apple are putting money into games. Esports is projected to have one of the biggest game programming in the US and globally. Our cultural obsession with games is nothing new. We, as social animals, are playful, and games are our tool. Attention will go there. Overall, I'm always curious about this game/media conversion. Though, I am wary of the harm of what the inevitable abuse of gamification elements by the game companies (or their new parents) will bring to society. But as always, that won't stop us, and we'll work on half-measures that take twice as long later on. As the future comes, we go on. (article in comments)"}

{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "What happens when value becomes noise? \"Providing value\" has been a buzz concept for as long as I can remember. If you're doing any marketing or sales, it's drilled that you have to provide value upfront. You want to give things away and only then ask for something. (Jab, jab, jab, right hook, in the words of Gary V.) There's absolutely nothing wrong with this advice on the surface. It's great and admirable. But eventually, with everyone doing this, all this value becomes noise. Buyers are DROWNED in e-books, playbooks, swipe files, checklists, webinars, and all the follow-up recordings to those webinars they registered and never attended. Eventually, all that \"value\" becomes noise, and the challenge remains: how does a seller stand out? Value no longer stands out. And this is only accelerating as it gets easier to repurpose content with AI. You do the webinar and turn it into an e-book, chop it into an article, and turn it into a carousel. Then, you send it to all your prospects and hit the checkbox for \"providing value.\" Eventually, rather than badgering leads with meeting requests, you're now badgering them with free content. So what's a seller to do? I don't know the answer (sorry), but it doesn't seem that the solution is more content in more forms. My mind goes to \"relationship-building,\" which is often another well-intentioned recommendation, but what does that actually mean? When I dig into that advice, it goes back to some variation of \"provide value, but make it PERSONAL.\" Then we're back at the same spot of inundating with value. And again, to be clear, I get that it's all with good intentions. Though remember, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. And my hell is my Recent Downloads folder with 17 e-books, 6 recordings of webinars, and 8 checklists/playbooks. That does not even touch what the LinkedIn feed looks like. The pendulum is swinging, and my hunch is that at some point, the sellers that stand out will be the ones who are okay to be completely upfront about their pitch, \"This is our product, this is how much it costs, and here's a link to a video that shows the demo.\" Tell me I'm wrong."}

What moves me is seeing people being impacted by good business and good marketing. I have been touched by good business and brands and marketing and think it has real magical power in a collective way, not in a supernatural or religious sense, but more in the socio-cultural realm. There's power to brands and demigods and celebrities and a real reason why we as a collective human species over time and space have always cultivated and culminated these sort of stories. Some of these stories exist as what we normally call brands. The demigods (and the stories about them) have a certain pull, a force, and an attraction. Do we embody Hercules when we wear Jordans? The demigods themselves embody values and qualities, and we have storytelling rituals (and that includes costumes such as jerseys, designer bags etc) that HELP US EMBODY THOSE BEINGS. That's the key ingredient - it has to be mutual. We have to be able to get a taste of the demigod, of the divine. We have to be able to embody it if just for a second. That's why they're demigods and not gods. Half god, half human. We love these stories. We love imagining these things can exist, because psychologically these things exist, clearly, through all the stories through history."}
{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "Contrary to concerted marketing efforts, social networks today don't foster real inter-community interactions. TikTok (which usually gets lumped into the social media category) recently denied they're a social network and instead is an entertainment network. The social part of social media turned out to be a mirage. Many attempts have been made to break through today's moats built by Facebook. However, networks like Discord are fascinating because they entered through the \"gaming\" world, which as a universe is already built on top of an existing content architecture (i.e., the actual game itself) that you would engage, interact, and generally socialize over. With something Like Facebook, the interactions themselves become the content that the interactions happen. It's like a Ponzi scheme of content creation. See Roblox as it became the go-to meta destination wholly built on top of a gaming network. One of the reasons for Twitter's longevity is that its social network is built on top of an existing content framework, in their case, \"news and culture.\" News/culture (the macro ecosystem that we're all part of) is constantly generating content in the form of cultural happenings and news. The social interactions on Twitter are built over those interactions. This extra buttress of content allowed Discord to outcompete FB in the real sense of building a social network and community. This is one of the reasons why Discord is the network of choice for many web3 initiatives and ventures. There are other attempts at having decentralized social networks; one of the more experimental initiatives is the federated social network. Using that a few years ago gave me the epiphany that digital social networks can bring real connection in ways that are mainly absent on the algorithm-driven social networks of FB/IG in the last ten years. Plato and his cave come to mind. New things in the industry are coming as marketers experience new possibilities of community and connection (as envisioned by the initial Internet pioneers) by having new Internet tools."}

I'll say things like \"ga4 - reporting on page visits how to help me\" to get the conversation going. (This is actually how I learned to use GA4). The reason is that I know I will need to give the LLM more feedback and guidance beyond the first try, no matter how much I try to optimize for zero-shot prompts. I'd rather get the conversation going and see an output to give feedback to rather than overload it with information and overload myself with a barrier. I tell people this, too. They will get so much more value out of it with a 50% effective than a 100% effective prompt that is too unwieldy to use in the middle of work. Overthinking the first prompt will stop people from actually using the tools. The value of AI really emerges through the conversation and the iterations of feedback within the chat.

Those people left essential marks on the world and led fulfilling lives. Being remembered by history is a fluke. 4) There's no playbook. 5) In addition to successes, their stories were also beset with failure. They faced ridicule and rejection, as did/does everyone else.

The marketing should feel seamless and natural; let the customer feel they discovered the brand and product on their own. That's a pull instead of a push. Like the design of a great product, it's invisible yet enhances the overall experience. It's the sum of the parts, the gestalt. Nothing about good marketing (from the impression to the sale) feels forced, with just enough balance to move a person through the journey. Most importantly, there IS a journey. The journey is invisible and becomes part of a larger experience for the customer as they join a larger community, that of a customer and potential champion. The journey from contact to customer to champion is the invisible flywheel."}

{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "I oscillate between excitement and cynicism about the AI stuff. You know .. *waves hands vaguely*... all this \"AI stuff\" - the advancements, new features, and breathless announcements of what could be coming next. On one hand, it's so cool to see so much innovation happening. On the other hand, it's all so recursive - we're adding layers of abstraction without fundamentally changing what we're trying to accomplish. Example: Recently Google announced Jarvis, which allows for the AI to interface with your computer. This is coming on the heels of Claude's introduction last week of their \"computer use\" feature which allows Claude to have control of your computer to perform tasks on your behalf. (Microsoft, Apple, and OpenAI are also working on something similar). I know it sounds like a big breakthrough, but the idea of an AI using your computer to book tickets... isn't that crazy. In the \"old\" world, I start at google, the backend is code, and the interface is the browser. I then see a bunch of options and I click on the things I want. In this \"new\" world, I start at AI, the backend becomes the website, and the interface is the chat. I am given a bunch of options and I click (or say!) the things I want. The action to the consumer is the same, as is the end-result (the plane ticket). There's always an invisible backend, and there's always the human interface. What happens in the backend doesn't actually matter to the consumer (that's why it's the backend). What happens in between the backend + interface is relevant for entrepreneurs and engineers, but to the user, the fundamental experience persists: we express what we want, and the system delivers. Let's put this in perspective: The fact that you can buy your ticket electronically on a computer is already crazy. (And the fact that I can use this ticket to go a thousand miles in a metal tube that's flying 5 miles up in the air is actually the craziest part of all this). Whether it happens through some HTML/HTTP protocol on the backend, through a website that's rendered in your browser, or if it happens because an LLM processes that HTML rendering of the website to do the thing you're looking to do, is less relevant. So there is novelty to this, but it's not anything transformative. The \"computer use\" then just becomes a more advanced API, in that I'm able to have new tools integrated with other in new ways. Which is awesome, and of course there's going to be some AMAZING new use cases out of this, in the same ways that APIs opened up a whole slew of use cases of software over the last few decades. This isn't to diminish the tech achievements behind these developments, it's just to contextualize. Innovation doesn't always have to be revolutionary to be valuable. The history of technology is full of small steps that compound into meaningful progress - but we don't need to make incremental steps to be leaps. Sometimes an upgrade is just an upgrade, and that's okay."}

Even harder sciences like math and chemistry are full of anomalies and contradictions when you get close to them. There's so much juicy treasure in the land of exceptions. On Pareto's chart (of 80/20 rule fame), the 20 are the exceptions to the overall. Boundaries and ideas are pushed at the edges. You can only be cutting edge if you're right on the edge. These edge cases as rule-breakers exist in marketing. Any truism in marketing has exceptions. People want transparency, but mystery and intrigue can work even better. Nostalgia and futurism mixed into one. Price works until it doesn't. It's like humans are full of nuanced, complex reasons for being. The breakdown between classic Newtonian physics and quantum physics is like that too. At certain scales and conditions, the rules literally break themselves. I avoid applying one solution or playbook to any particular problem. Gems are found in the exceptions, within the shards of broken rules. Let's say you're following a playbook for \"marketing.\" Many of the recommendations would have dozens of easily-recalled contradicting use cases. There's nothing that's figured out, and we're not any closer to figuring out \"marketing\" in all its messy prevalence than we were 20 or 50 years ago. We've had more than a hundred years of the marketing/advertising industry. That's 100+ years of all the studies done, all that experience and knowledge people received, all that money that was spent, and all those textbooks published and revised. And yet, we still get it wrong en masse. We still have to throw up ideas against the wall, disagree with other ideas, and still deal with the human component of individuals and teams. Marketers and owners still struggle to determine a product market fit, keep people and their team motivated, and keep the lights on. There's no singular solution or problem, for that matter. Instead, each part plays into the larger whole, guiding the results and outcomes. For me, marketing is the most accessible thread to pull at to maximize a business. And the magic is in that; coming up with something and doing it without being guided by a pre-determined playbook. It is knowing where and how to adapt. Strategically, creatively, operationally. Every rule will have a counter-rule, or an example will come to find that successfully bucks those trends. So what's a marketer to do without playbooks? Anything."}

The role of \"marketing\" in a company is an extension of its view on the \"customers\" and what they mean to the company. There's no right or wrong way to this, and different companies approach it differently depending on the founding philosophy (written and not). However, a large enough view of marketing and its strategic value to an organization must be broad enough to encompass companies' contrasting decisions. Sometimes those beliefs are driven by financial values embodied by the founders, sometimes by moral/ethical ones. Either way, the organization becomes imbued with that philosophy across all functions. Marketing provides another framework upon which to view the business world. It relates to the company's approach to the relationship between the company, customers, communities, and creators. These C-words are the nodes of today's digital meta-world (commerce + social + entertainment).

It's just that I, as Customer, don't want to agree to terms with a company very boldly and clearly called Captive, as I agree to terms of \"Captive\". \"Click here to agree to be captured\" I think sometimes we as marketers forget customers as humans, and because of our profession instead see them as like some sort of prey. And so then the marketer becomes predator. Like tracking, capturing, targeting (and retargeting!!). Very hunting language. (and fishing too, with terms like hooks and whales) Not calling out Captive at all. The UX was great and service was great and I'm sure they're doing great work. Just sometimes I look at language too closely and wonder what it all means."}

The more that a system is interconnected, the more resilient, more efficient, and more effective it is in delivering outcomes. Marketing is the same way. When you understand this reality of marketing, it's a lot easier to then see why marketing focused on going deeper outperforms going broader. It's easier to understand why multiple touchpoints and multiple channels become imperative to create awareness and engagement. Building relationships with customers and fostering an ecosystem with them isn’t just a talking point that sounds good, it follows natural law of how systems and organizations grow."}
{"instruction": "Write a social media post in Pavel's style.", "input": "", "output": "One of the reasons for this VC purgatory is the lack of differentiation between the many DTC brands there are now. •the visual aesthetics overlap. Everything is slick, clean, minimal, with bold colors. It may look great individually, but the brand identities blur together. This has to do with the “algorithm” of content, because much of the visual content brands create is for Instagram’s platform. “The medium is the message” rings truer today than ever. •many of these DTC brands go the pop-up route. Because of overlapping brand aesthetics, many of the pop-ups wind up looking alike too, with a heavy emphasis on being “Instagrammable” - which creates a physical space focused on taking quick, shallow pics. There is not enough focus on actual HUMAN experience or interaction. •much of the brand differentiation is conveyed through product features. There are few grand stories being shared, no championing of people, and no exciting truth being proclaimed. •the product differentiation isn’t actually differentiated at all either. A large portion of the product story is “comfort” and “convenience.” Everything is now convenient and comfortable. “Delivered right to your door!” was exciting when it was a mattress for the first time like 5 years ago; now it’s the default offering."}
