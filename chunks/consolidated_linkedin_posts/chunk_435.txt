It’s a hydra of ideas; creativity all the way down. The old ideas don’t die out, either. They’re still here for improving, remixing, and inspiring. Everyone from product, customer service, design, and marketing tap into this infinite well. Everyone involved in the brand adds their unique experiences, outlooks, and expertise, molding together to produce a new insight that leads to a new idea. And the cycle begins anew."}
