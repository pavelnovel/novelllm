AI systems, while highly capable, cannot give feedback to themselves. They rely on human input to refine their outputs and get the desired outcomes. Domain experts have an advantage in giving such feedback because they know what to look for, what to ignore, and where the common mistakes and big insights could be. They will be able to suggest specific ACTIONABLE changes, iterate the direction across multiple rounds of conversation, and add the relevant nuance that an LLM lacks. This is how experts will continue to deliver a competitive edge to businesses. Remember, a system cannot give feedback to itself. The people who know how to give good feedback will have an advantage here. Targeted feedback will guide AI systems to produce higher quality, more relevant results. In turn, this opens new ways for AI to enhance human capabilities and drive growth. Upward cycle, commence! This is the new expertise flywheel."}
