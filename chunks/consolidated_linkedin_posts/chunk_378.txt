A bunch of posts in my feed are coming with follow-up prompts that get answered by AI. There's always a \"Takeaways\" option to get a quick summary of a post, video, etc, and then custom questions that also get answered. It seems to understand the video content and also the content of whatever link is being shared. It then uses that content to craft custom questions and answers. I am only getting limited access (in their attempt to get me to upgrade to Premium), but I got some screenshots here. With LinkedIn being owned by Microsoft, it's no surprise that AI features are getting integrated on the platform. There's even an opportunity for LinkedIn to become a model of how social networks can integrate AI. My predictions: 1. We'll see some sort of LinkedIn bot for knowledge sharing. Maybe even a celebrity bot. (Imagine asking an AI Richard Branson bot questions about entrepreneurship) 2. We'll see a native integration of AI-generated comments (that's probably going to suck). 3. Some sort of AI matchmaking for lead generation in Sales Nav. Maybe my bot reaches out to your bot, and if it's a match, then the humans get introduced. (Instead of \"have your people call my people, it'll be \"have your bot call my bot.\")"}
