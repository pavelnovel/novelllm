I'm thrilled to OFFICIALLY announce that I will be helping lead Aleph One Marketing (A1M) as co-founder and CMO. This opportunity came after an acquisition by Aleph One venture studio of Some Growth Agency, a marketing agency founded by Jess Bahr, who followed her entrepreneurial destiny with flair. In only three months, she grew and scaled that marketing agency to nearly $1M ARR. I'm excited to work with Aleph One, who invests in and builds custom software for pre-seed startups, to develop high-impact marketing programs for their portfolio companies. Beyond that, I'm also excited to share strategic alignment with Aleph One's CEO, Stanislav Synko, to utilize their deep technical expertise to go all-in to build AI-powered products and tools for marketing teams, big and small. This is going to be so fun!!! Fun Fact: Jess is one of the first marketing friends I made 11 years ago (on Twitter, no less). It's a full-circle moment across the board, and I'm curious to see what's next!"}
