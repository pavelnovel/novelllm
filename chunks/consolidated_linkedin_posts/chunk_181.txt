Common misconceptions about AI in marketing: either as a magical solution or as an unreliable tool. What they need to proceed: education, use cases, and ideas. Experimentation Businesses start with AI in small, isolated tasks, like generating a single blog post or analyzing a small dataset. Often, there's one champion of AI within the company, and the founders are curious enough to proceed. What they need to proceed: tracking & quantifying results internally (anecdotal & qualitative counts too here.) Expansion Expansion of AI use beyond content creation to include research, analysis, and customer insights. Teams are using it together. What they need to proceed: case studies, webinars, whitepapers. Integration The unification of AI across various marketing platforms and tools; creating a cohesive, automated marketing system. Heavy use of automation (usually no-code/low-code) Need to proceed: buy-in at all levels, working with experts/consultants. Normalization (No company is there yet) Business-wide AI integration (beyond marketing), running in the background of the business in 75% of all activities. Envision a time when AI is not just a separate technology but it's almost part of the default experience of digital information. Much in the same way WiFi and cloud access are, or SpellCheck. Need to proceed: continue to stay innovative, thought leadership across the industry."}
