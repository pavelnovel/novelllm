If it’s not differentiated, if it’s not unique, if it doesn’t have a defensible point of view, or a perspective that can lead to anything meaningful, then don’t worry about adapting it to different channels or formats. Instead, keep working on the message. Iterate and go through the reps of sharing something meaningful… once. It’s garbage in, garbage out."}
