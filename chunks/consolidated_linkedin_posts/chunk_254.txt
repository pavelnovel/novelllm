Nothing is dead, and nothing dies. It all gets absorbed into new things. All of these things evolve. Specific techniques may be dead. But the thing itself transforms, recombines, and changes. When I started my first job doing SEO for local businesses in 2012, Google's Panda and Penguins updates were wreaking havoc for search marketers everywhere. The way you did SEO (especially some of the black-hat tactics) back then indeed died. Although I'll argue that the core principles remain the same: create valuable content for people. Yet here we are. SEO is as undead as ever. Is Google's dominance of \"search\" threatened by AI? Yes. Will Google have to adapt? Yes. Does that mean SEO is dead? No. Same for email, influencers, short-form videos on social, and everything else that comes, but doesn't go away. We are in a world of zombies rising out of the ash, all peddling new tactics and strategies."}
