Imagine, for something to be so advanced that its state is said to be that of art. This gives a bit more context to all those pesky \"is ____ art or science?\" questions. I heard that phrase on a webinar today about marketing. Is marketing more art or science? But also, stems from a simplification about what science (like real science) actually is. Science isn't an antithesis to art. Science is full of unanswered questions and questioned answers. There's no definitiveness to science. Everything is a theory or hypothesis, with people poking about, throwing ideas on a canvas to see what sticks, and can we make it stick again. Sounds like a whole bunch of art. So, is marketing art or science? Call it art and go be a scientist, call it science and go be an artist!"}
