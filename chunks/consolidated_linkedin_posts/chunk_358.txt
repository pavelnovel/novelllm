Out of curiosity, I checked to see if they engaged. No likes or comments from them, but they clearly remembered this post enough to have mentioned it. And that's not the first time that happened. It's a great reminder that most people on LinkedIn (and other social networks) are lurkers. If the only metric you're following is likes and comments, then you're missing a whole lot of conversations. Ashley Laabs shares more in our latest episode of the Marketers Talking Marketing podcast. Link for the full episode in the comments. P.S. Our podcast is almost 18 months old! If it was a baby, it's walking by now. We have a new episode every week, where (as the name implies) marketers are talking marketing. It's great, insightful fun. Check it out, don't be a lurker"}
