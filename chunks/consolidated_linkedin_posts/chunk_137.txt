Often, this dichotomy is reinforced by a prioritization of different KPIs and metrics, namely that Brand Awareness=Impressions, and Sales=Clicks. However, in reality, consumers don't respond neatly to your funnel. Dumping money to drive Clicks, will inevitably build awareness of a brand that has no story and no organic community that attracts empowered customers. Dumping money to drive Impressions, without first establishing and understanding your brand, will lead to a nebulous \"community\" of people who respond to your message but don't take action. Brand awareness and conversions are the right and left hand necessary for a resounding clap."}
