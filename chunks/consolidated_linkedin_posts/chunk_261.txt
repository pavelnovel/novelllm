If a particular ad is successful, you can only repeatedly show it so many times before people get blind to it, bored, and move on. If a message/angle is successful, at some point the culture and consumer preferences will change and the message no longer resonates. If a particular tactic is successful and stands out, other companies will copy it and it will no longer be as effective because it gets drowned out by everyone else doing it. Like all things in life, there’s a natural deterioration that happens. That’s why constant innovation is a must."}
