{"timestamp": "2023-02-15 04:19:51", "text": "We're in the World Wide Web stage of AI. Standalone services/products like ChatGPT will not be the future of AI. It's too clunky of an experience to go to a dedicated place to \"use\" AI. Instead, we'll see more and more tools seamlessly incorporate AI into their toolbox. That's where the technology will proliferate. For example, Todoist is my go-to tool for to-do lists/project management. Notion is my go-to for note-taking, planning, and note-taking. Notion and Todoist both have introduced AI into the product. It gives it an accessible & compelling use case. More and more of the tools that knowledge workers use and love will continue implementing AI into the background, further boosting productivity, output, and performance. Eventually, AI will become a standard integration across anything we use. In the same way that we expect our tools to save data on the cloud, stream videos without downloading, and share seamlessly across desktop and mobile. ChatGPT/Dall-E is a necessary first step, but it's the equivalent of having AOL be the entry point into the World Wide Web. Eventually, we will get the \"Internet.\" And after that, AI will be just the default, invisibly powering everything. AI will eventually become a standard integration across all types of technology. AI is not just a passing trend but an integral part of the future of technology."}
