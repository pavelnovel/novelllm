The recent controversy with sharing Netflix passwords highlights the shift in our evolving relationship with content. From journalism to education, commerce, and politics, much of the last 20 years has been influenced by our access, interaction, and consumption of content. We no longer pay for ownership (defined by the physical form), and instead, we now pay for access to content and the experiences that come with it. It's not just the content itself; it's the convenience, timeliness, and curation of that content. The shows and movies themselves are just a part of the value. This raises the question, what do we consider to be ours in today's society? Is an account ours to share, in the same way we can share a book from our shelf? Who owns what? Not to overstate this framing, but this question of Ownership is a defining one, one which society is constantly asking and answering. (Remember, 175 years ago, a certain German duo asked about capital, labor, and ultimately ownership.) Absent from this debate, too, are the actual creators who are creating the content. While seemingly unrelated, four months ago, we were collectively debating the Ownership of Twitter and the expectations, responsibilities, and possible outcomes resulting from ownership there. Arguments were made around content visibility (free speech vs. censorship) and account access (banning and re-instating). This goes back to this evolving relationship to content, its access, and our expectations of platforms that mediate these relationships. Into this mix, I can also throw in the thorny perennial issue we've been dealing with surrounding privacy, tracking, and ownership of data about us. These aren't just social media or streaming platform questions. These are broad societal questions packaged with familiar logos and names."}
