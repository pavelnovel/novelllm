I don't know how true this is, but apparently when Roman generals had their victory parades, someone would stand behind them whispering \"Memento Mori\" - \"Remember you will die.\" For marketing teams, it would be someone whispering: \"No one cares about your brand story\" \"Your viral campaign will be forgotten next month\" \"Someone's garage project will make your whole strategy irrelevant\" They're not there to be cynical. But to whisper the truth that the market is its own living thing. That product-market fit isn't permanent. That people move on. That most people, most of the time, simply don't care. And yet - this is the beautiful part - we still continue to do our thing. Because the market keeps on, and marketers continue to market. Still seek that next insight, still find new ways to say something, still try to build something worth caring about. Maybe when we're celebrating our wins, we need someone reminding us how much luck played a part. And that's okay. Because all we can really do is keep playing the luck game, to try to stay in it longer, and keep building things worth remembering. Even if they'll be forgotten."}
