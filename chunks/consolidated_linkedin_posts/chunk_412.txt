{"timestamp": "2023-02-01 19:55:40", "text": "\"Going viral.\" A phrase that excites, irritates, and confounds marketers and non-marketers alike. I love how media/marketing people borrow phrases from other disciplines in describing concepts. And \"going viral\" is one of the most popular phrases thrown around in the last decade. As marketers, we usually want things to go viral (for the right reasons, of course). But the actual mechanism of virality is a lot more nuanced. The way that viral or exponential growth operates is that it explodes after a seemingly slow period of growth. That second part is important. Business leaders always focus on the explosion rather than the slow growth. However, the slow growth part is necessary for the boom to happen. I also hear it when people talk about \"hockey stick growth.\" It compares the growth to the blade part at the end of a hockey stick because that's where all the excitement happens. But the only reason that analogy even works is that you have a much larger part that's straight until the very end. And you need both parts to have the hockey stick. That initial period is dull, unexciting, and mainly about consistency. And that's what makes it hard to do. But you gotta do it! (This applies to not just marketing & business but personal life as well. Insert your own comparisons here.)"}
