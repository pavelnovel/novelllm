Frameworks Positioning, differentiation, and messaging are about framing (and reframing). Different framing gives new insights, leads to new consumer perceptions, and reinforces distinct branding. A frame doesn't work without a framework (pun fully intended). Marketers use frameworks as blueprints for building strategies, layouts for organizing, and maps for navigation. They help us determine: 1. Where we are 2. Where do we want to be 3. What do we have to get us there There are dozens of frameworks in the overflowing toolbox of marketers today, like a messy alphabet soup: 4 Ps, 7 Ps, SWOTs, AIDA, STP, 7S, 5W, 4E, 4A, HERO, plus many more Frameworks give us structure, foster collaboration with a shared language, and drive improvements with iteration. Besides sharing a common etymology, frames & frameworks are a testament to modern marketers' creative and strategic mindset. That's where my love for poetry and marketing intersect: they challenge and inspire me to think beyond the obvious."}
