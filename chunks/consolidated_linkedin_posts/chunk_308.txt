It was a productive and fulfilling several days, of meeting great people and hearing new ideas. Definitely felt too short. Never feels enough time for all the conversations and get-togethers. I had an amazing time hanging out with all the folks from Aleph One that came, including Stanislav Synko Oleksii Shevchenko Nicolas Mazuryk David Pierini I didn’t take a lot of photos (I never do) but here’s Jason Koo advocating for Neo4j and talking about red threads (it’s all connected), a random photo of a street in San Diego (looked more postcard-y in person), a reliable elevator (great name), and a cookie and a macaroon I ate (delicious combo). Like I said, I really didn’t take a lot of photos. Thank you Startup San Diego (and Ella Napata) for putting this on. I’m already excited about next year’s event and I’ll try to take more photos!!"}
