We need INSIGHTS to do things differently. to execute differently, to lead differently, to relate and communicate differently, to pitch and present. If we can do these things differently, we can do everything differently. We can then run our startups and lives differently. And differently doesnâ€™t always mean better! Based on your measures of success, there are better and worse \"differents\" We then need some self- and company-awareness to see if this is the good or bad different, and what to do about it."}
