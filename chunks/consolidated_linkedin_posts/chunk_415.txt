Marshall McLuhan’s works were highly influential in college in guiding me towards the intersection of media and advertising, specifically his later work The Medium is the Massage. (Note, his intentional usage of “Massage”, and not “message.” With that he was emphasizing the soothing, enjoyable, and relaxing nature of media in how it physically works over us.) Some interesting points from that book, which was published in 1967 , but is still just as relevant today: Politics offers yesterday’s answers to today’s questions. All media are extensions of some human faculty; psychic or physical. This is the world we inhabit, consume, and build our identities in. The extension of any one sense alters the way we think, act, and perceive the world. These altered impressions lead to ever-changing forms of expression."}
