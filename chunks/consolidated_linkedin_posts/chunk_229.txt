I feel like we are getting into an era of AI Intelligence (totally understand how redundant that sounds, kinda like saying ATM machine). There's a skill and craft to understanding and relating to AI, how it can interprets, and how it functions. Prompt engineering is just the start of it. How do you prompt a machine? The word prompt is meaningful here, as a verb. To coach (someone) and assist (a learner or speaker) by suggesting something forgotten or imperfectly learned or known. That's a great perspective of what we do when we prompt Gen AI. Suggesting, subtly guiding, and even leading. PS - \"prompt\" is also a great Scrabble word to keep handy. Not a lot of words with such a high consonant-to-vowel ratio with the less common letters."}
