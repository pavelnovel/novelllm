We’ve been a media sponsor of this art fair for three years in a row and it’s amazing to see the growth and progress. I’m super grateful to be involved and it’s been amazing working with Emma Warren and the rest of their team. Also earlier that day, I spent some time at a workshop learning about luxury fashion design with sustainable materials with Joshe Ordonez. Thank you, I learned a whole lot! It was a truly creative, mind-opening weekend."}
