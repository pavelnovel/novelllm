The metric at issue was for how long, on average, advertisersâ€™ video ads were being watched. Because of the error, the average watch times of video ads were exaggerated for about 18 months. The viewership metrics apparently were inflated by some 150 to 900% From the full memorandum: \"Facebook acknowledges there was an error. But Facebook has argued strenuously that the error was an innocent (!) mistake that Facebook corrected shortly after discovering it. Facebook has also pointed out that some advertisers likely never viewed the erroneous metrics\" It's funny seeing FB refer to something of this magnitude as an \"innocent\" mistake, and then funnier to see them be like \"well some of you weren't even looking!\""}
