{"timestamp": "2020-03-02 23:20:16", "text": "option a: $100k on social ads + $2k spent on \"brand + content\" vs option b: $90k on social ads + $12k spent on \"brand + content\" option b, over 6-12 months, will go way further in business returns. The social ads will be more effective content with higher sharing, engagement, and conversions. the social ads will also help build the brand, because all those impressions the social ads receive will be more memorable and engaging as they're part of a larger, encompassing story. but most of us already know that. we all know what we \"should\" do. whether it's business or personal, our problems are never our lack of knowledge. we all have information we need to stay in shape, to maintain financial health, to be \"productive\" at work, but the problem isn't the not knowing, it's the not doing and making the hour-by-hour decisions. we all \"know\" that doing things like creating a more compelling story, figuring out the Why, understanding key values etc, lead to higher returns on all marketing for so many reasons. but rarely do we \"do\" the things that prioritize \"compelling creativity.\" ideas: -create time & dedicate energy for unstructured conversation -talk to customers for their perspectives & worldviews -immerse yourself & team in creative experiences or workshops"}
