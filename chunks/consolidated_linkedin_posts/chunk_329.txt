I'm exploring remote roles in brand and cultural strategy: think Strategy or Marketing Director/VP for a tech company, lifestyle brand, or reputable agency. Additionally, I'm open to hybrid/on-site marketing or cultural programming positions: think Marketing Director or Head of Cultural Programs at an art museum in Miami/Fort Lauderdale (more on that soon). Your connections, advice, or any opportunities you might have would mean a lot to me. Thank you in advance for your help! Overview + work samples: https://lnkd.in/ecANa9jA"}
