It fills my heart and my life with such joy and abundance of love. It has shown me richness that money can never touch. These babies also remind me of our common humanity. Like the fact that EVERYONE was a baby at some point is wild. The biggest thought leaders, the most important CEOs, all these sales reps and influencers and qualified leads were once little babies learning to walk and talk, shitting themselves, and crying over the dumbest stuff. And maybe now we are all just really big babies that got good at certain things and forgot their baby nature. So ponder that when you catch someone taking themselves too seriously. But what do I know? Iâ€™m just a former baby who became a dad."}
