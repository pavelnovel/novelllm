NAVIGATE your way into the middle —Position yourself strategically, network, and leverage your skills to get the core of your industry/community. 2. BUILD around you —Create value, foster connections, and develop resources that attract others to you, establishing yourself at the center naturally. Both paths require vision, effort, and a commitment to growth. Truly becoming the center, will also involve both paths. But you can lean into each path based on your current place, strengths, and opportunities. Which path resonates with you now?"}
