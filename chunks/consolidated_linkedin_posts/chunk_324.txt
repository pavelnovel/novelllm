After the dot-com bubble in the late 90s, today’s tech giants emerged. We have yet to see the disruptive AI companies. They’re harder to predict because if they were easy to predict, they would have already emerged. We will start to see the impact of these AI companies across lives and businesses. This goes beyond generative AI. The enhanced ability to compute data, process information, and model language naturally will drive this transformation. AI won’t replace humans, but it will replace many incumbents. Some of today’s giants will survive and return to compete again (just like Microsoft, which missed the mobile revolution but came back strong in the AI revolution). Some won't, but out of them new companies will emerge through the same people. There's a difference between PayPal and the PayPal mafia. The latter has longevity that's tied to the humans. These tech giants don't die, but morph into new things through the founders. By the end of the decade we will have the makings of a new landscape for the digital world, one away from social networks and feeds. And AI will be a core component with its ability to generate, analyze, and model worlds. I'm curious not just about the companies, but who will those founders be? One of them may be starting college right now who knows."}
