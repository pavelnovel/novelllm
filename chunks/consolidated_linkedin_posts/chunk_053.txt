Usually, when people talk about marketing they've done, it seems that people initially approach marketing only through the lens of advertising/promotion. In reality, marketing (as a function & process) is a whooole lot bigger than just advertising. I help people recognize the depth of marketing because it'll unlock many new opportunities to differentiate their companies and reach people in a meaningful way. Everything from the product's price, the name & logo of the brand, colors used on the website, the words used in the Thank You emails, the photos selected, is part of marketing and is thus an OPPORTUNITY to differentiate. Remember the basics, the 5 Ps of marketing: Product, Price, Promotion, Place, & People. (and for context, Advertising is just one part of the Promotion-P). All of those elements present ways to do something unique. And that's just the start; marketing offers many more frameworks that can add perspectives to discover distinctions. However, you have first to recognize that opportunity to be proactive and intentional. You have first to be aware of that capacity to act & market in that way."}
