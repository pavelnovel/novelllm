I love and use Notion, so I'm cool it...but I don't know if it's just me, but it feels like every tool is integrating some other tool now. My note app launched a calendar, and my calendar app launched a to do list, and my to list lets you store notes now. And they all connect to each other. And now all them are integrating AI on top of that. Is it just me? Everyone's doing something else. All grabbing at something. Google doing ChatGPT stuff, and ChatGPT doing Google stuff. Calendars doing to-dos, Netflix doing games. The pendulum always swings from scrappy startup to a vassal building a new moat. When does integration become bloat? What happens to the hungry software that eats everything, including its own tail?"}
