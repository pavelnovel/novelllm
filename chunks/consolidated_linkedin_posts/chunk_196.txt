This advice has helped a lot with strategic clarity, tactical execution, AND my own mental health. It's especially been helpful to write it out by hand on paper. It could be because I stop looking at a screen and reset my attention. Maybe another part of the brain (and muscle memory) gets activated when I pick up a pen and write. Whatever the reasons, I'll take the results. The writing doesn't even need to be long. Literally 15 seconds is enough to flush out whatever is muddying up mind."}
