Email impressions, social impressions, A/B tested for creative and copy, and copied the results into templated decks. Impressions became a standard unit of measurement. But I've been thinking about what an impression really is. The word itself comes from the physical act of pressing into something, much like ancient writing tablets, leaving a lasting mark that contains a meaning. Think about the social dimension of impressions. Think back to the last time someone truly left an impression on you. Perhaps it was someone at a conference, or at a friend's party. They left a particularly strong impression, for whatever reason. Maybe their outfit stood out, or something about their point of view struck you, or something they said, or the way they laughed. Now contrast that with being counted as an \"impression\" on someone's marketing dashboard, with barely a half-second scroll past content. What impression does that make? Almost none. What's fascinating is how genuine impressions often come from authentic expression. Consider the times when people left impressions on you. There's usually some element of their expression that stood out. And specifically, it's those elements that left their impression on you. Sometimes looking at familiar words with fresh eyes reveals their forgotten depth. Are we counting moments that truly leave a mark, or just collecting vanity metrics? The irony isn't lost on me that we chose such a meaningful word to describe such a shallow measurement."}
