Take inspiration from playwrights and authors of the world. It's a strategy to celebrate, strengthen, support, and spoil people. It's to connect the inside to the outside, the one to many, and the many to one. I can be meta with marketing, but I'm convinced that a grand picture is necessary to guide a long-term strategy, especially in an industry/craft as dynamic as marketing today. This grand picture should account for future platform, algorithm, and social paradigm shifts. The adaptability must come from a broadly flexible framework to the value of marketing within the organization. The role of \"marketing\" in a company is an extension of its view on the \"customers\" and what they mean to the company. There's no right or wrong way to this, and different companies approach it differently depending on the founding philosophy (written and not). However, a large enough view of marketing and its strategic value to an organization must be broad enough to encompass companies' contrasting decisions. Sometimes those beliefs are driven by financial values embodied by the founders, sometimes by moral/ethical ones. Either way, the organization becomes imbued with that philosophy across all functions. Marketing provides another framework upon which to view the business world. It relates to the company's approach to the relationship between the company, customers, communities, and creators. These C-words are the nodes of today's digital meta-world (commerce + social + entertainment). The interactions and relationships between those Cs result in different products, results, and cultural impacts that companies have. Many ways to these many outcomes, but the different decisions are still within a singular marketing framework that helps guide the company forward through the change."}
