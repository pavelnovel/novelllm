They give you 95% of what you need and trying to find more can be spinning circles. If you really want a third one, get Perplexity. And get ChatGPT and Claude on your computer. They have Mac and Windows apps. Set up the hotkeys, make it easy to access. For me, Control+Space gives me Claude and Option+Space gives me ChatGPT. These are exceptional tools (I also recommend getting the the $20/mo Pros for both, but that's a separate post). We just have to make it easier to use them. This isn't a prompt hack, but just a human psychology hack, finding an easier way to build AI into your workflow. We habituate ourselves to everything. If you work to make using AI a habit, you'll see the benefits, you'll see new uses, new ways it helps."}
