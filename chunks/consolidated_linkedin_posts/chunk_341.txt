Dove released a generative AI prompt playbook with a guide for creating humane and inclusive beauty when generating AI imagery. The playbook was surprisingly well-done with a thorough primer on image generation using AI. Love to see companies embrace the inevitable (However, the stat that 90% of content will be generated by AI is suspect. I looked at the source, and it came from a soundbite without supporting research. In the original soundbite, it was stated that we \"might reach 90%,\" which is different than \"is predicted.\" Either way, I'm not here to press semantics. There's gonna be a LOT of AI content, and no one actually knows what the specifics of what the future holds.)"}
