It's easy to see how analytics can lead and feed creativity. Analytics will give us insight into what's reverberating, how people respond, etc. This can provide stronger direction and inspiration for further creativity. But don't forget the reverse: Creativity feeds analytics. Things need to be first created before they can be analyzed realisticallyâ€”different copy, different creative, different positioning, etc. A focus on consistent and varied creativity will add meaningful distinction and insight into the analytics, making it useful. If you're running the same campaign or the same ad for months at a time, you're not actually analyzing anything useful. Empower analytical thinking and creative thinking, trusting they're two sides of the same coin."}
