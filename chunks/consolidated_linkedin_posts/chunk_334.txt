I have no idea what's going on, but naturally I'm curious. So I screenshot the whole page of the match updates and pull up Chat. Get a breakdown of the score and the basic explanation of what the score actually means. It even explained what's happening in the photo and why it's significant to the match and what effect it has on the score. I know a lot of people look at ChatGPT as a work tool, but it has also helped me understand so much more of the world around me, in a really easy and intuitive way. The multi-modal input is great too because I can now provide immediate input into what I'm looking at. Because content without context is useless. PS - The MacOS ChatGPT app is a game-changer. The less distance between myself and the world's greatest knowledge tool, the better. I hit option+Space and I feel like Neo."}
