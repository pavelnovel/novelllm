For each card, extract and fill in the available information. If only the name and company are present, still include that as a separate record. Ensure that each row corresponds to a unique card and leave any missing fields blank. Create a file for the output that I can export as a CSV.\" Claude then generates an .md file that you can immediately download. Rename that file to a .csv and you can then throw that into your CRM and do your follow-ups etc."}
