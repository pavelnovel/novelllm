It will add new depths of involvement in work and new human associations. It will eliminate old routines and break down old barriers. AI will enable us to develop new skills and specialize in previously impossible areas. AI will create opportunities for collaboration and innovation, leading to new industries and markets. We will begin to value uniquely human attributes such as emotional intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and innovation. And regarding all the conversations that AI threatens creativity: Creativity is not just about producing beautiful works of art! It's primarily the process of self-expression and connection with others. THIS is the value of creativity for humanity, and that's why it's irreplaceable. The artists of our time, as the artists of any time, will incorporate the new tools of our media to create, refine, select, and connect the message to the human experience."}
