People aren’t seeing your ad with objections in their heads. They don’t care. They’re not even seeing your ad. Thus the good thing is that the person has fewer internalized objections than you think. So there’s less to overcome. You just need to stick in their minds. For that, you need their: Attention and imagination. Marketers have been methodical at getting attention through digital platforms. The users, their eyeballs; we’ve captured their attention. But their imagination still runs wild. Imagination overcomes irrelevancy because your visuals and words spark new ideas. You can’t forget ideas or unsee connections. That’s the thing about impressions and when you make them. You can’t un-imprint it or ever peel it back away, without making a bigger mess. Impressions are crucial, not for attention, but for imagination. But real Impressions. Not inflated metrics where commas separate value. Impressions were you feel a click with recognition, emotion, and wonder unfolding, and curiosity sparked. That’s the impressions that stand out."}
