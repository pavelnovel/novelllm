The response has been awesome so far, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It's great to see companies like CzechTourism recognize the value of visual storytelling, and has been an incredible partner in letting the narrative come to life. Check out the video and leave a comment with your thoughts! If you're looking to capture powerful stories through video for 2020, shoot me a message."}
