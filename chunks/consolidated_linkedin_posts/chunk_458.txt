Whom you celebrate as a brand embodies the values the brand collectively holds, and becomes what you celebrate. So if you want to open up that conversation, even internally, about brand identity, think about whom your brand can champion. What type of people? Who are they? What type of creators? What type of stories would you hear? You can use that as a framework to continue the necessary work of further building your brand. Then you can even act on that list of people and build programs around them. Maybe start an invite-only community, or put on an event with a panel featuring some of those people. Launch an editorial series about those people in a way to further reinforce your brand values. As long as you have the people, you can do anything. Better yet, you can just ask them what they'd want to do. Never overlook the value of the surprising insight your community holds."}
