Most recently, the news that TikTok has overtaken YouTube in total watch time came as a surprising, yet almost inevitable, development. How did it happen? Much can be said about the recommendation algorithm and all the data that goes into it. My bet is that it had something to do with the ease of creation. Creating for YouTube is a hassle, compared to TikTok. Instagram didn’t just make it easy to post pictures. It made it easy to have your photos be shareworthy with the application of filters. TikTok did the same for videos. It allowed users with no video production skills to post shareworthy videos. Over time, having more and more content on the platform allowed the recommendation algorithm to become a competitive advantage. (With that said, that’s also how YouTube got big in the first place, with their barrier to creation between much lower than existing networks and platforms.) Now we are seeing a massive rise of creator funds from brands and tech giants, which are just extensions of the same creator-first ethos: help creators to help the platform. Curious to see how that will all develop further."}
