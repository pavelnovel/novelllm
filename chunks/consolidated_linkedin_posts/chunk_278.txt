And for that, it must align with their other beliefs. The reinforcing of existing beliefs is like using judo. Each person has an array of existing ideas. You have to find a few levers of connection. You may yourself have those very beliefs. Identify the thoughts that pull along the actions in the journey. Thought leads to action. Understand that marketing is better at nudging along a path than redirecting completely."}
