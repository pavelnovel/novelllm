I've very much a nerd for thinking about workflows, and how tools, processes, and people come together to get actual WORK done. Tightening up the workflows prevents basic operational failures, like miscommunication, and also frees up the mind-space of the knowledge workers involved to do what they do best and apply their knowledge to do better, more intentional work. I'm a big fan of Zapier and Airtable (as a user-friendly database). Almost all the operations of my agency & media company have been documented, and everything from biz dev, to client success, to editorial calendar has a clearly defined workflow that goes across the tools we use. Effectiveness AND efficiency!"}
