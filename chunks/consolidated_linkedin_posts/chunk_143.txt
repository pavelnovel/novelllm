Because TikTok and Snap are fun, and Discord (which is parallel to Slack in functionality) makes communication super convenient for them. But just because Gen Z is congregating on TikTok and Discord, doesn't mean that Gen Z is a generation that you can segment by digital platforms. And that's because Gen Z is really that post-Internet, post-stream generation. To them, digital platforms are not these separate entities on this special thing called The Internet. Digital platforms are just platforms, just other places that exist in THE WORLD. The distinction between online and offline/IRL and all that, loses all meaning. What happens when digital is no longer a separation? How much of this is in parallel with the mass blurring of work & leisure, consumption & creation? How does this change the approach of companies to the people who buy their things and work with them? The whole joke of baby boomers not being able to work with millennials will be overshadowed by the massive difference between Gen Xers/older millennials and Gen Z that will fill the workforce over the next decade."}
