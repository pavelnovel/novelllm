Paid subscribers offer a brand an owned community of recurring revenue (and attention). Subscribers (reached via email, SMS, and DMs) are crucial today for long-term business growth. Also, these same people are likely paying Premium media subscriptions that hide ads from them (Spotify Premium, etc.) So having direct, trusted, and opted-in communication to people who are PAYING to opt-out of advertising, is another tremendous value-add."}
