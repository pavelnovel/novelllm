MessagING. Even the word marketING itself. It's an ongoing activity. It's never static. It's always happening. It's not a set-and-done thing. The dynamism of marketing comes in a few ways: 1. Marketing is constantly evolving, with new technologies, tools, and trends always emerging. 2. For marketing to work, work has to be done, consistently and constantly. It's not writing one set of great copy, putting out a big campaign, and then chilling. 3. Adapting elements of marketing (from messaging, positioning, and targeting) to the actual market. This includes customer response and feedback to competitor analysis and larger social zeitgeists. And each of those elements are themselves constantly changing. It's a beautiful, complex system."}
