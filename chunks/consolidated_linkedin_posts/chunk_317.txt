That's a pull instead of a push. Like the design of a great product, it's invisible yet enhances the overall experience. It's the sum of the parts, the gestalt. Nothing about good marketing (from the impression to the sale) feels forced, with just enough balance to move a person through the journey. Most importantly, there IS a journey. The journey is invisible and becomes part of a larger experience for the customer as they join a larger community, that of a customer and potential champion. The journey from contact to customer to champion is the invisible flywheel."}
