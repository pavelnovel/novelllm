Companies that are waiting to start thinking about/doing marketing until whatever internal milestone is hit remind me of people who say they will start exercising when they get into shape. Talk about putting the cart before the horse... Even if there's no external push/launch of marketing, the marketing team must still do plenty of internal work. Content to queue up, design assets to create and approve, systems to build up, welcome emails to write, etc. Otherwise, this stop-and-go effort will get poor results. Much like a stop-and-go approach to exercising."}
