{"timestamp": "2024-06-10 04:04:49", "text": "\"Advertisers don't need to know what's right about the product, only what's wrong about the buyer.\" (possibly attributed to the brilliant Neil Postman) Provocative, yet it misses critical nuance. My big problem is the word 'only' in \"...only what's wrong about the buyer.\" Thoroughly understanding what's wrong with the buyer—their daily lives, challenges, and pain points—IS central to effective marketing. To actually say the right things about the product requires knowing what's wrong in the lives and work of people using it. Marketing is a dynamic dialogue between the product and the market. Achieving product-market fit requires a deep understanding of the buyer's challenges (often unspoken and unidentified). These insights can come from anywhere, from a founder's intuition to rigorous data-driven methods like A/B testing. Once you understand what's \"wrong\" with the buyer, you begin to understand the product's value in a tangible, real way. Now, communicating the fact that you have the solution is a whole other game. This is where the art of copywriting and positioning comes in (a vital auxiliary skill for anyone involved in driving revenue and go-to-market strategies). But that's for another post."}
