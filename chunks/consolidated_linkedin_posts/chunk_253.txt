I was going to write a long post about how gardening is a lot like marketing, with allusions to seeds, roots, and watering. But you get the gist. I will say that patience and trust do pay off. I didn’t think this plant would make it. It got decimated by whiteflies early on and just looked sickly through a few months. But we kept taking care of it. And the plant grew a flower and then a tiny little pepper came out. It’s nice to see a project come to fruition. Erm, I mean a plant."}
