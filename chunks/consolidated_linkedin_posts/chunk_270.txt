It manifests as cycles (business cycles, economic cycles). Our lives have seasons. Sports teams have different seasons. Rebuilding. Dynasties. There are seasons for connection, for rest, and for grinding. It doesn't make sense to plant seeds in early winter. Plant seeds in early spring, so you can harvest in early fall. Know what season you're in, and work with that. Remember that with cycles, things come back around, and you can start anew. Timing is as important as the amount of time you put in."}
