This Friday still feeling blessed, basking in being a dad x2. Secondtime around is less worrisome, and easier to notice the fleeting moments. What a year it’s been too with life and work. We are at the half-year mark of 2023 and there’s so much more to come. I hope the second half brings new wisdom, new gratitude, and even more love."}
