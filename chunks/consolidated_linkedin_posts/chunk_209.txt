Document all my automations that mainly live between Zapier, Make, and built-in tools within Airtable and Slack. To optimize automations and better troubleshoot them, I gotta quickly know where they live and what they do. ❷ Improve copywriting ❷ Take and finish a copywriting course. Why copywriting? Because the prevalence of AI content puts great, persuasive writing at a premium. (Drop any compelling recommendations for courses into the comments ). ❸ Customer development ❸ Talk to more customers! I can rarely go wrong by talking to more leads and customers. As Steve Blank says, get out of the building (and speak to the people outside your org)! ❹ Inspire ❹ Put more hope and inspiration into marketing messages. Hope and inspiration form the foundation for many compelling stories and campaigns. They're the refreshing antidote to the anxiety found in media today. Today, hope and inspiration will stand out and resonate more than ever. Less FOMO and more joy. ❺ Ignore competition ❺ I'm going to read fewer case studies, best practices, playbooks, etc. It sounds counter-intuitive, but constantly looking at what others are doing can stifle creativity. I can be a digital hoarder. Over the years, I've downloaded many resources, from checklists to ebooks. I've subscribed to so many marketing newsletters and listened to countless podcasts. Did it improve my marketing? Sure. Did it lead to analysis paralysis? Definitely. What can I do better in 2024? Ignore what's happening outside. I have accumulated enough knowledge and examples. What will I do instead? Execute and iterate. Explore original questions and perspectives. Continue writing more myself. Expression over impressions."}
