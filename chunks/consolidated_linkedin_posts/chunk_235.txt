Earlier this week, my co-founder Jess Bahr and I embarked on a total calendar cleanse. We stripped it to its bare bones, removing all pre-existing meetings and standing calls. Our objective? To rebuild our schedules with a more intentional focus on where our time and energy should be spent. The key was to facilitate more deep work sessions – times when we are fully absorbed and where productivity is at its peak. We changed some meetings to async sessions that'd use Looms and text. We batched calls into single days (client calls on Tues, internal check-ins on Wed, etc). Today, I'm glad to report that this restructuring has already shown a huge improvement (and a clear inbox!) I've been able to create more, contribute fully, and experience a sense of satisfaction I've missed in recent months. It all started with acknowledging the internal discomfort of feeling like I could do more (knowing there must always be time to sharpen the saw). I shared this self-frustration with trusted allies and, most importantly – took decisive action, which in this case was a calendar cleanse. My realization is this: Time management isn't simply about fitting everything in. It's about making space for what truly matters."}
