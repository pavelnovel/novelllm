Feel free to apply to anything else... ‣ Start with 1 bar. ‣ You need ~16 of those bars to make a verse. ‣ You need ~3 verses for a song. ‣ You need about ~12 songs for an album. ‣ And then about ~10 albums to cement a legacy. Initial quality (kinda) matters, but the commitment to quantity via consistent output will shape the quality more than anything else ever can."}
