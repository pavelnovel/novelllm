The key is to zoom out and see the bigger system, to see each part fits into the whole. Fine, you can now make limitless AI-generated images. But, how does it fit into a larger brand identity? How can you sequence, order, and curate those images to tell a cohesive story that communicates the brand values and vision? Also, remember there's a skill in knowing what NOT to use. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. There's a question of timing and purpose. Over the last 10+ years, marketers have wrung their hands about the Internet, social media, YouTube, Instagram, etc. Ease of photo publishing via Instagram gave us influencers; easy video publishing gave us vloggers. Each new technology ushered in a flood of new content. What did marketers do? Adapt. Figured it out somehow. There will be winners and losers. Some of the losers would be unexpected, and some of the winners aren't even around today. Stay curious."}
