The \"worst\" thing for a brand isn't to be outcompeted, out-promoted, or out-storied. The worst is for the brand to become irrelevant, where people are indifferent. It's when no one cares about the company, from customers up to employees. Take a stand, have a vision, share collective care, champion someone. Do something; just don't become irrelevant."}
