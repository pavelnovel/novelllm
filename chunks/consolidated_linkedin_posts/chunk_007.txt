For those that don't know, Yik Yak was a hyperlocal social network built on anonymous public messages of people sharing their opinions, questions, thoughts etc. It had exponential user growth in 2014/2015, mainly on college campuses, and then kinda fizzled out. I'm always curious to see new social networks emerge, and it's doubly interesting to see one \"re-emerge\". I don't think it'll ever get big enough to challenge Facebook or anything, but it's had that appeal of being a real \"social\" network. No ads, no brands, just people being people. PS- It's back on iOS only for now."}
