(Yes that peanut butter cookie brand) They've embraced madness, suspense, an overdose of deep-fried meme aesthetic, and a mysterious character named Aidan. They're doing this for the Zoomers, I know, but I like to think they're doing it for all of us. A few years age, they were making brand-safe, tongue-in-cheek content. It was cute, but not at all outstanding. The switch happened around q1 2023 (which also led into a masterful April Foolâ€™s joke. (Yes I went down the whole nutty rabbit hole here) What they're doing now, though... you have to see it to understand. Or not, as the goal is not to \"understand\" but to \"vibe.\" I love the embrace of the madness, the chaos. The differentiation here is *chef's kiss* I would LOVE to have been at that meeting where they went back and forth on this. I know there were some people in that room who didn't get it and pushed back hard. Yet here we are. Another brand showing that rules don't exist. Sometimes a brand gotta be mad, weird, and especially unserious. The lesson here for any marketer is irreverrance. There are no sacred cows. I for one stand with Nutter Butter and what they're doing."}
