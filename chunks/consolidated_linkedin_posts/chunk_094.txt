Each layer becomes a touchpoint, another opportunity to connect & resonate. Layers go beyond A/B testing certain copy or using different channels. It’s about building depth, with people at the forefront. It’s about giving current & potential customers a way to peel back those layers and engage with the brand. All those moments not only build towards the buying decision, but also towards the sharing decision, in which they communicate a portion of the story to their friends. Give people something to talk about!"}
