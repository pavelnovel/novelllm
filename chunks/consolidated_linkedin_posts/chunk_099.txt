The more creativity, the less certain things become. A lot of the marketing conversations I've been hearing all exist within this spectrum. Conversations around targeting, attribution, and optimization usually deal with questions of Certainty, and how to get more of it. Conversations around differentiation, storytelling, and disruption deal with Creativity, and how to foster more of it. There are useful frameworks and models to help clarify some of the uncertainty, whether it's AIDA, 5 Ps, or the various Positioning Matrices. There are wonderful creative exercises you can do to unlock the creativity of you and your team to craft stronger, more compelling ideas. Ultimately however, certainty is never assured. Algorithms can change, new startups can disrupt your “certain” models, and your customers may just move on to something else. Creativity will never go away. Creativity bolsters resilience, longevity, and leads to new territory to be certain about. Creativity, and the ability to create new things, is your only certainty."}
