While there are some exceptions, in general, taking the brand less seriously will open you up to new, creative ideas. (bold, di$tinct ideas) When marketers take their brands too seriously, they're reluctant to do something unexpected. And if you always do the expected, then you're just treading water. Being not serious does not mean unengaged or unintentional. Quite the opposite. By not taking it too seriously and loosening the expectations, we can fully engage in the work of the brand's content and community, without all that \"seriousness\" getting in the way."}
