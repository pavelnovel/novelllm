Quick psychology refresher: The Hawthorne effect comes from studies done in the 1920s and 30s that found that workers' productivity increased when they believed they were being observed or studied, even if the environmental and working conditions were not actually improved. The takeaway from those studies for social sciences is that workers' productivity was influenced not only by their physical environment but also by social and psychological factors. That's not to say that 4-day workweek findings aren't \"accurate,\" but my heretical side is forever curious."}
