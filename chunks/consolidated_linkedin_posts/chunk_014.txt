Nature overtaking land is a natural process, and weeds themselves aren't inherently \"bad.\" You'd be surprised at how many plants that are considered weeds have medicinal and nutritional properties. However, it's just a matter of what you actually want with your land. (INTENTION) The weeds make it difficult to see the possibilities of the land and block your view. (CLARITY) Weeds aren't just a problem area for the place that has the weeds. Like all plants, they tend to spread, with roots growing under the ground that stifle other regions. They compete for space, water, and sunlight, and some weeds like vines can physically restrain shrubs and trees from growing. Speaking of roots, much of the weeds' growth that weeds comes from underneath, where you don't necessarily see them pop up until it's too late. They keep coming back, so you need to keep a constant eye on them. (MAINTENANCE) There are many metaphors here for business and life. It reminded me of the need for Clarity and strong Intentions, and the Maintenance required to build a healthy business and a happy life. What we do when we grow brands, careers, or networks is much of the same process as tending a garden. Let yours be bountiful!"}
