Already the feeds are full of hacktics. This book is something else entirely. It’s about the deep current beneath all marketing, Older than the internet, older than capitalism, Older, maybe, than written language itself. It started with a question I couldn’t stop digging at. What is marketing, really? Where does it live? Why does it work? Why does it not work? Why does it matter? I’ve spent five years inside this question. In rooms and Zooms with founders. In conversations with consultants and CMOs. In solo early-morning writing sprints, And late-night rabbit holes that led Here. and Here is what emerged, a Book told through seven lenses, across time: Marketing as Language Marketing as Human Nature Marketing as Imagination Marketing as Work Marketing as Technology Marketing as Science Marketing as Risk There's three parts: past, present, future, Plus something I can only call the Ephemeral. These ideas aren't about being right. They're about being useful. More like a compass than a map. Take what you need, bury the rest. If you’re a marketer, a founder, a strategist, a builder, Someone who considers the craft and its consequences, This is for you. I’m sharing thoughts along the way. Not as content, but as offerings to You. If You want to follow the journey, here’s the link: https://lnkd.in/eMuhzWMN Coming October 2025."}
