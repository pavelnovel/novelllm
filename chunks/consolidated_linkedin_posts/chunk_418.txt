When people hear branding, they usually think of sleek, modern design, cool websites, bold colors, etc, etc. Branding is so much more. Craigslist has created a distinct identity, which is the essence of strong branding. People know what to expect from Craigslist. There's reliability there. The website and design meet the expectations. It works on all platforms. The brand experience is simple, quick, and accessible. (Plus, on top of all of this, their whole branding is future-proof!) It's a misconception that branding is only something sleek and sexy. It's why some founders believe there's a trade-off between advertising and branding and that one takes away from the other. Like in all things marketing, there's magic in finding the right combination & balance, whether it's between advertising and brand, story and data, or copywriting and targeting."}
