A separate room? A corner of the bedroom? Boundaries have different. Boundaries as an inter- and intra-personal concept is paramount today. We all partake in boundary-setting. With family, with friends, with clients, co-workers. Often, however, we're not aware or intentional about setting boundaries. And not setting any boundaries is in itself a form of boundary-setting. Setting boundaries with ourselves becomes even more crucial because that's how we recharge and redraw our strength and inner power to continue to serve and lead. Boundary setting can be as simple as maintaining even a quick morning routine and keeping a consistent cut-off time for when you're finished with work for the day. These time blocks will also help re-establish your home as a sanctuary for wholly enriching your life in different areas. By establishing boundaries (done with kindness and empathy towards others and self), we create the time/space that we need to be at our best."}
