Having the right perspectives on emotions can reveal new positioning for brands and products. \"Less lonely\" vs. \"More connected.\" The destination may be the same, but the journey is different. The power of emotions isn't only relevant in B2C marketing. B2B users resonate with positive emotions too. A marketing dashboard tool can be considered easy to use, inexpensive, highly integrated, etc. A dashboard tool can also provide a feeling of clarity. Clarity is good because it allows people to simplify how everything is tied together and helps them feel their actions make an impact. Addressing that emotional state in marketing can be persuasive. You can go beyond clarity and think about what happens after achieving clarity. What do we feel? Relief, satisfaction, and even enlightenment. Imagine your marketing team feeling relief, satisfaction, and a sense of enlightenment. That brand evokes different feelings than any feature-based positioning."}
