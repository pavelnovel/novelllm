Making time for gardening is grounding for me (literally). Working with my hands. As a knowledge worker, it's important for me to remain in touch with the physical world. This includes DIY projects, arts and crafts, or simply putting something away. This weekend I put up a little bird feeder and sawed wood for future gardening projects. Uninterrupted creative time. Writing poetry is my go-to. Creative input. Reading fiction, listening to great music albums, or watching great films. I finally got around to watching Everything Everywhere All At Once. What a masterpiece! Physically organizing my space, cleaning up the house, and getting the surrounding in order. Weekly review following David Allen's GTD methodology. Includes reflecting on past actions, organizing current work, projects, and open loops, and planning future actions. I don't always get to these every weekend, but when I get this in, it's hard for me to have a bad week. I'm always looking to expand these practices, so share any of your favorite weekend routines that help give you clarity, focus, and peace!"}
