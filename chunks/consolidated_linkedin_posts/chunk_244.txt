Have you decided it's time for a community-led outreach strategy but don't know where to start? Let's talk. As of June 2nd, I am investing 100% of my attention into The Culture LP, the leading cultural marketing consultancy that has come a long way since its early days as a blog. My journey has been a winding one, filled with twists and turns, yet each experience has prepared me for this moment. Over the years, our team has developed cultural programs and marketing projects for some of the biggest names in the industry, including the California African American Museum, Apollo Theater, Block Inc (Square), The Public Theater, Carnegie Hall, Brooklyn Museum, NY Philharmonic, and more. 2020 was a watershed moment; however, many brands and organizations have failed to put action behind their empty promises. What sets our work apart is our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and community building. Let me help you achieve your business goals and build a better future for yourself, your team, and your community. Learn more about my work: http://bit.ly/hmtportfolio"}
