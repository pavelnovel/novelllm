Imagine as a thought experiment that you flip it. 90% of all the company marketing energy would go towards celebrating, empowering, and championing your existing customer. You give that group of people so much love and attention that everyone wants to be in the group! The purchase/transaction just becomes an entry ticket to that experience. Word-of-mouth goes up, press coverage goes up, and crowd-sourced content goes up. Any existing marketing you were doing (that remaining 10%) becomes ten times because each new customer will have higher retention, buy more, and tell more people. So now, instead of churning through new customers, you're building a supportive community that organically looks to grow (because that's what humans do). That's how you pull customers vs. push."}
