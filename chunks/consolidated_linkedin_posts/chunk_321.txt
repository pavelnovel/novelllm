They know how to be proactive, get things done, and hit their goals. Now, tell them they can only use fax machines for all internal communications. Sure, they can still use email with clients etc, but for talking to each other, for executing their work—they’re stuck with fax machines and phone calls. Now, imagine another team. Same size, same industry. Dysfunctional. No real connection, no vision, no initiative. But they have every tool at their disposal, the Internet, smartphones, and especially the biggest elephant in the room: AI. Who would you invest in? I’d bet on the first team. Every time. Why? Because tools aren’t everything. The first team will figure it out, and maybe even make a differentiating strength out of it. It’s an extreme example, but it makes the point. Access to a tool isn’t the same as mastery over it. (Also mastery over tools isn’t mastery over operations, but that’s another post for another time). The conversation around AI is part of a larger conversation about human work and how we use tools. It’s an exciting conversation that we’re only starting to have, and will evolve over the years."}
