Marketers don't say \"play\". There's always a disconnect in the language. That's because the seller and the buyers think about different things. The more we share that thinking, the more we resonate. Shared thinking is: ‣ shared language, ‣ shared experience, and ‣ shared community. That's the holy trinity of marketing."}
