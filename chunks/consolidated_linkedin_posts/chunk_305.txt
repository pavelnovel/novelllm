Regular degular. But the company powering this form is called Captive and I guess they're a company that does this Wi-fi / customer connection and data capture. It's just that I, as Customer, don't want to agree to terms with a company very boldly and clearly called Captive, as I agree to terms of \"Captive\". \"Click here to agree to be captured\" I think sometimes we as marketers forget customers as humans, and because of our profession instead see them as like some sort of prey. And so then the marketer becomes predator. Like tracking, capturing, targeting (and retargeting!!). Very hunting language. (and fishing too, with terms like hooks and whales) Not calling out Captive at all. The UX was great and service was great and I'm sure they're doing great work. Just sometimes I look at language too closely and wonder what it all means."}
