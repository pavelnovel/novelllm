Whether it takes 3 months or 3 years, many assumptions about the future will be made, tested, and overturned. Predicting the future is an even greater challenge, which is why we don't do it. Instead, we go towards it in every decision we make. We're continuing to build Squirrels.AI. The team, Jess Bahr and I are more excited than ever by the possibility of helping marketers start to use AI in their work. What started as a mad weekend experiment is quickly becoming usable and valuable. In addition to the SEO gains we're seeing on the B2B content side, our work on the B2C side with clients is also beginning to show results in Google. We're pulling Squirrels back into private beta as we build additional programmatic SEO features that let you programmatically create 100s of unique pages. We're also refining the content generation process, given all the recent improvements to current LLMs. Our constant human-in-the-loop, providing human expertise at every step, also helps with editing, fact-checking, and strategic alignment with the content. It's a fine line between complete AI control and a fully human-led process. It's also a fine line between focusing on building the product or pushing on the marketing. There will be many more fine lines to walk, no doubt. We hope you'll walk with us. Hit me up if you're interested in chatting more about whether AI content generation makes sense for you."}
