And then comes Elon Musk said, \"You can't kill something already dead.\" Power move, I guess . Anyway, I've been thinking a lot about the rebrand. Much commentary has been that Elon Musk is killing decades of brand equity. Shallow analysis. Renaming something doesn't simply erase it. Anyone who's had a beloved hometown stadium renamed knows this. People will still call the stadium by the old name for years. What makes Twitter Twitter isn't the name. It's the entirety of the experience. (The boat of Theseus much?) The brand of Twitter has been undergoing a shift since the purchase. Then it became Elon Musk's and fused with his \"brand.\" And his brand is messy and irreverent. Some people love it. Plenty of people hate it. But either way, the brand is palpable. Renaming the service doesn't diminish that. I can make the argument that it re-invigorates the brand. It brings the service-f.ka.-Twitter into a larger universe of brands, one that even transcends Musk's brand. The brand of X. His obsession with it (going back to his original wish to have PayPal be called that). He never let it go. His recently launched AI startup: x.ai. SpaceX. Tesla Model X. His son with Grimes X Ã† (pronounced X). Was it the right move? I learned that there's usually no definite thing as \"right\" moves with branding. Time will tell, but sometimes you do need a fresh start."}
