Consider where line breaks happen and what words lead each line. Emphasize the visual harmony between the copy and design. Give your copy room to breathe. White space highlights p o w e r f u l words. Balance the imagery of the page with the copy. Speaking of balance, implement a visual hierarchy with smart use of formatting options, headings, and subheadings. Feel free to break these, and all, rules."}
