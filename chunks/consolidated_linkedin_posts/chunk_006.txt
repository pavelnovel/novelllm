I haven’t just been thinking this question, I’ve been LIVING it. Failure is scary. My soul knows I’ve run away from it. Avoided doing some things because of imagined failure (and the imagined pain that it brings). There are still parts of my life that I’m presently unweeding and unwinding because of my past avoidance of failure. But when I move towards failure, either the past or the possible, I find glimpses of success. And the glimpses are bright. They’re the small waves that bring upon change. Success goes with failure, like the flower and the roots. Face one and embrace the other. One can't happen without the other. They're mirror images reflecting each other, with us standing in the middle."}
