They're submitting stories and photos on social, they want to volunteer at the events, and they're telling their friends in the press about the company. Imagine employees so aligned and excited to work and belong at the company that they're often buying things from the company as gifts for their friends and raving to family about them. To get great customers, great creators & workers are necessary. And good luck affording any employees when there are no customers. The chicken is the egg. The egg is the chicken. Cultivate a strong story and build an excellent product that energizes and inspires anyone who comes across it."}
