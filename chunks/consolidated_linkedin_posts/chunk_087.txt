So without further ado, the 2020 color of the year is Classic Blue A dependable, inviting color that plays off the universality of it. It’s a year (and decade) focuses on wellness, both personal and planetary. In a fast-changing world, the familiarity of Classic Blue maintains a connection and reliability. Thanks to Svetlana Legetic and ARTECHOUSE for inviting me and putting this wonderful, multi-sensory, immersive experience together, along with Huge."}
