It’s a subtle but essential distinction to understand how 21st century capitalism is shaping to be. In capitalist terms, you are now the factories and the factory workers that create the products. Facebook et al. are just the land upon which the factories are built upon. That’s all they need to own. What do the factories build? What are the products in a capitalistic world that’s increasingly virtual and artificial? It’s personalized recommendations, feeds, playlists, and hyper-targeted interruptions. It’s the things that FB peddles to make their billions of dollars from advertising. FB is building a $1T company where the factories and labor are not only free, but aren’t aware that they’re those things. That’s important because 100 years ago, the consciousness you collectively had of being the factory workers at least allowed you to BELONG to this collective, you had collective power (via unions), and you weren’t alienated. Imagine a factory operating 24/7, being staffed by unpaid factory workers who don’t even know they’re factory workers, and instead think they’re just enjoying leisure time. Oh and they build the factory themselves."}
