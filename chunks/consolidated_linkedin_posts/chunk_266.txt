When done right, the marketing should feel seamless and natural, as if the customer has discovered the brand and product on their own. That's the hallmark of marketing that pulls instead of pushes. It's like the design of a great product - it's invisible, yet it enhances the user experience. Nothing about good marketing (from the branding, and positioning, to the campaigns) feels like a sales pitch, yet it draws you in and leaves you wanting more. It's almost effortless. As marketers, we need to strive for that level of seamless integration with our customers."}
