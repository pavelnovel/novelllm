Integration with existing tools to help make existing systems smarter. Research — Market research and analysis to examine large volumes of data, summarize findings, identify patterns, and even suggest strategies based on the analysis. Creation — That's the big, obvious one. Use this to generate copy and creative. For everything from social ads to long-form blog posts. 90% of the hype around AI currently rests in this element. Analytics — Takes big data analysis beyond traditional operations. It's also very useful on the fly. More than once, I was able to copy-paste large swathes of data from a CSV while on a call to get immediate insights and answers in a matter of a few minutes. Curation — Leveraging analytics and research to suggest changes based on results. More granular segmentation will blur the line between curation and content repurposing."}
