Ever since I read Jane McGonigal's gamification all those years ago, I've been on the lookout for the power of gamification elements in our mediated digital interactions. Reading this article sparked ideas of how closely linked gamification and attention are. Here, games don't only refer to common conceptions of games like console/PC games (think Call of Duty or The Sims), but all sorts of games we engage. Think of all the attention shows like Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune garnered. All the commercials during those breaks. Speaking of commercials and games, don't forget to include the Super Bowl, which has the largest attention share of anything ever. We make games about games (fantasy football). We have communities and groups and influencers and shows talking about games. We make reality TV about games. In the last decade, some of the biggest cultural phenomena were Hunger Games, Game of Thrones, Avengers Endgame, and Squid Game. Selective picking, I know, but there's a theme. There have been plenty of huge acquisitions of game companies over the last few years. Netflix and Apple are putting money into games. Esports is projected to have one of the biggest game programming in the US and globally. Our cultural obsession with games is nothing new. We, as social animals, are playful, and games are our tool. Attention will go there. Overall, I'm always curious about this game/media conversion. Though, I am wary of the harm of what the inevitable abuse of gamification elements by the game companies (or their new parents) will bring to society. But as always, that won't stop us, and we'll work on half-measures that take twice as long later on. As the future comes, we go on. (article in comments)"}
