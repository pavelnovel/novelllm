The birth of a company marks a shift in perspective because now, unlike before, here exists a world in which your company, and its name, exists. The naming of something is a sacred divine rite. The naming of something and the saying of name is one of the roots around some of the various rules of religions against the depiction of figures. Depiction, or saying of name, desecrates it. The saying of something has power. Knowing the words, where singing a song or rapping along, is a powerful harmonizer and connecter. Something almost magical or sacred happens at that moment. Or when you see yourself in a certain uniform, sport, profession, or from your favorite band (or brand). Exhibition and habits, same etymological roots too. The uniform, masks, and lenses we put on determine how the world sees us and how we see the world, and considering both are reflections, those two things are one of the same. We put on icons that imbue us with powers of faith. Confidence. Icons. Luxury, athleticism, care. Bumper stickers, laptop stickers, logos. We canâ€™t help but to reflect. In founding the company, the founders wanted to reflect something; having the job or craft you have now is a reflection. Everything outer life is a reflection of inner life. Outer brand is a reflection of the inner brand. Brand is an extension of company culture."}
