Curiously, part of our marketing language contains dehumanizing and even violent linguistic contexts. Driving traffic. We drive cattle, not people. Tracking. Targeting. Capturing leads. Very predatorial hunting language. Even the very word branding! That comes from branding cattle so you can identify the owner. And I sometimes feel that way when someone begins describing their ICP as a bunch of facts like they're dressing up a puppet and creating this hollow shell of a 25-34 year old female with HHI of $100-150K. Where's the story, where's the spirit? It's always there for that person, and there's insight in that story. Insight that can be used to differentiate, to inspire, and to lead."}
