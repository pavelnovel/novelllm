'Projects', in addition to last week's big announcements with 3.5 Sonnet and the introduction of Artifacts really upgrades its usability of as an organizational assistant (Also, shout out to Anthropic for quickly bringing usable updates into Claude instead of just teasing vague future enhancements.) Quick notes on Projects: - allows deeper collaboration by creating a self-contained workspace for specific projects (as the name implies). - each Project has individual chat histories, custom instructions, and knowledge bases, and allows for uploading additional doc to provide extra context - if you have the Team plan, you can invite specific members to collaborate on the project and have them share their own docs and knowledge bases. One way I'm thinking about Projects' use case is similar to how I'd make a Slack channel for a specific project, add all the relevant docs, and have conversations around that project. This is a BIG step towards making AI more collaborative and focused on day-to-day work. For example, say you have an upcoming project launch. You can have a Project around that where you have information related to the product. You can have separate chats about writing out the press release, some of the messaging for the product, and coming up with a media plan for the media buying team. After the launch, you can use this project to analyze all the data, organize and summarize all the customer feedback, and create a doc that you use with your team for review. And you can have that all contained within one workspace, which makes it easier to find, follow up on, and collaborate.
