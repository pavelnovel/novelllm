Luis doesn't speak english. and as I mentioned, i don't speak spanish. So i'm thrown into this. immersion to the fullest. the first lesson was real hard. like everything was flying over my head and i was just nodding along in so many of the interactions, and just saying si like some dummy. The next lesson i began to stop him and telling him i don't know and i don't understand. he would explain and repeat. and i would tell him again i still dont understand. and then he repeats. and i still didn't know. and this would go on and on. I was getting so embarrassed I was sweaty, and my social instinct was telling me to nod along and just move on. eventually, i was able to string together some understanding of what he was saying and respond meaningfully. that felt real empowering. I wouldn't have gotten there had I not been willing to admit to how clueless I was. anyway, this is a lesson i hope to return to more. and in time, and with enough \"I dont knows,\" i hope to actually become proficient enough so that in 10 years my kids can't talk shit about me (in front of me)."}
