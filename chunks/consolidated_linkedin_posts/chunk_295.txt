{"timestamp": "2025-01-10 18:03:19", "text": "\"Make your marketing human.\" I've heard this for 15 years. It’s related to the idea of building relationships, connecting with the human, and being authentic. But what does it mean? What is human, what is humanity, and what is its role in marketing? This will get more important as the world increasingly becomes ARTIFICAL and abstract. Marketing will shift to FACILITATING the connection of humans to humans and humans to the world. (IRL is the new status symbol. Look for more brands creating and emphasizing IRL experiences.) We are almost returning to some Enlightenment ideals, where the value of a human is simply because they are human and are imbued with the soul and all that stuff they wrote about. We’re returning to this inherent and essential (as in essence) VALUE of humans. The knowledge that a piece of art came from a human will beat a “technically” superior, yet artificial piece, of art. Is that logical? No, but appreciation and connection to art, beauty, and humanity has never been about logic."}
