(If you listen closely, you can even hear a few marketers shaking in their boots! ) It's called the Power of Promotion. The power of promotion is not to be ignored, It's the key to success, a message to be roared. From word-of-mouth to flashy signs, Marketing will always be a part of the grind. Social media, print ads, and radio waves, All have a place in the marketing craze. Finding the right balance will drive the success story, And give the product the fame and all the glory!"}
