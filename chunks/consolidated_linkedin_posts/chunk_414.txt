Strategy and tactics must function as one, each informing the other. Take the example of advertising. Insights from successful (or failing) campaigns can inform a shift in content focus, elevating your overall long-term strategy. And in turn, new content ignites new ad ideas, leading to more insight. The beauty of this interconnectedness is that they feed into each other, creating a never-ending cycle of improvement. Strategy is fluid, not static, and the most successful ones are constantly informed by the wins and losses of their tactics."}
