And I don’t mean knowing Boolean logic and advanced search tricks. Just simply the skill of getting to the answer I needed by searching the internet, rather than immediately asking someone else. (I’m sure you’ve had co-workers or bosses who interrupted your flow to ask something easily Google-able. I never wanted to be that person.) This is where most AI tools are today. There’s the technical skill of knowing HOW to use them, but there’s also a meta-skill of recognizing more use cases and remembering TO USE them. Imagine two marketers 20 years ago, both with access to Google. One uses it extensively while the other doesn’t. It’s not a certainty, but the one using Google likely gained more knowledge, had more context for information and trends, and used other tools better. Today, AI offers a similar advantage. It won’t guarantee individual or collective success, but it’s the most advanced information tool we’ve got."}
