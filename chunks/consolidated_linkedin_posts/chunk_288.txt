(Because honestly I don't remember a time I earnestly NEEDED to use the Caps lock key) So now when I'm mousing with my right hand, my left pinky can knock out those pesky Return presses. Before, I would have to take my hand off the mouse to find the Return key on the right-hand side of the keyboard, while my left hand watched helplessly Now, I'm a two-handed clicking and pressing machine!!!! (I have Mac and I used the free Karabiner-Elements to rebind the keys, if you're curious) Sometimes, a hardware change can make all the difference."}
