As a marketer, I feel like a sort of pride. Usually, people hate on ads. And for good reason, they’re interruptive, irrelevant, or just plain bad. But once every year, the whole country has a sense of anticipation, curiosity, and surprise. They’re excited for ads! And that’s kinda cool. Viewers use this as an opportunity to see what we're up to, what the world is up to. What new technologies and products are being introduced? What cultural moments are happening? Humans have often used commercial activity as a model of the world. I think of the merchants who voyaged off on the Silk Road or something and came back with enchanting things. Like imagine being some townsperson, and you know the merchants are coming back with the caravan after a year-long journey. Anticipation, curiosity. You’re now getting to see some new fruit or spice or seeing some new colorful silk. That was probably really cool. Watching the commercials is a little bit like that, and it taps into the same emotions."}
