The shift of referring to the Internet first as the \"World Wide Web\" may likely be the same shift that happens to the Metaverse. The Internet and \"world wide web\" as terms encompassing a concept are basically the same, but the latter sounds very dated. Right now, as the metaverse is new and cool, calling it that is fine. But in like 10 years, we'll have another better word for it, and calling it metaverse will sound antique. What we call things is important and is a milestone of adoption, development, and progress."}
