Everything is slick, clean, minimal, with bold colors. It may look great individually, but the brand identities blur together. This has to do with the “algorithm” of content, because much of the visual content brands create is for Instagram’s platform. “The medium is the message” rings truer today than ever. •many of these DTC brands go the pop-up route. Because of overlapping brand aesthetics, many of the pop-ups wind up looking alike too, with a heavy emphasis on being “Instagrammable” - which creates a physical space focused on taking quick, shallow pics. There is not enough focus on actual HUMAN experience or interaction. •much of the brand differentiation is conveyed through product features. There are few grand stories being shared, no championing of people, and no exciting truth being proclaimed. •the product differentiation isn’t actually differentiated at all either. A large portion of the product story is “comfort” and “convenience.” Everything is now convenient and comfortable. “Delivered right to your door!” was exciting when it was a mattress for the first time like 5 years ago; now it’s the default offering."}
