For years, I drowned myself with the wishful thinking that, \"If only I had more time, I could do this and that.\" (Or my other go-to, \"Once life settles down a bit, then I can REALLY focus on what matters.\") But guess what? It's a trap, and we're the cheese. Here's the mental pivot: Accepting that we'll NEVER have enough time and that life will never stop tossing challenges our way. And that's not a bug; it's a feature. It's also not a sign of personal inadequacy; it's a sign of being human in the modern world. It's been liberating to accept this reality. It's also helped me become okay with saying No. And saying No isn't some magical grand gesture, like turning down a million-dollar deal or a chance to give a TED talk. It's much more mundane, and there lies the power. It's about passing on that extra networking event or not committing to another 'quick' side project. Life doesn't offer stability; it offers moments. And it's up to us to navigate through them, finding our equilibrium where we can. Remember this: The long game is the ONLY game in town. You're doing just fine."}
