Track them like footprints in the snow, before spring brings new blossoms. New blossoms bring butterflies and growth. Impressions make imprints, as unique as fingerprints. The soul is catchy; spirit spreads. Have courage to be enchanted. There’s magic all around you. Merge with it. There’s more magic emerging within you. There are no mistakes in myth. Our imagination is divine, perfect for this imaginary world of minutes and Mondays. Making sense of conception, we can only grasp it whole. There is no sum of parts. There are no parts when feeling sun rays. Sundays are a million miles away, Saturdays are here. You only give what you have, and you possess the whole world. There’s no message except myself."}
