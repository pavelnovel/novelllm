The metric you look at is their lifetime value, measured only in their accumulated purchase currency. However, the value of customers goes beyond their purchase power. → One hundred customers living in the same building on the same block will offer more potential for growth than a hundred customers split across the country with no connection to each other. → A loyal customer who happens to be an up-and-coming local photographer has the additional ability to \"generate\" more value for the company. → A customer who's a customer because a close and knowledgeable friend raved about your brand has a different perception of your brand, one that positively spreads beyond your marketing department. These differences are negligible on a one-by-one basis. But aggregated, they create a massive shift in strategy. Over time, as these small dynamic customer factors accumulate, they compound to create a brand that seemingly grows on its own. The question then becomes, how do you design a marketing strategy that factors in these differences in the potential of customers beyond LTV? Just like the built environment influences individual behaviors (architecture, path-planning, etc.), a marketing strategy influences these individual behaviors where a customer's. These designs of marketing systems are invisible to customers (just like any good design). However, like any good design, they can all be intentionally planned, tested, and refined."}
