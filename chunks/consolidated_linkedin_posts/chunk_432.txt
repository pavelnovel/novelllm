It's the generalization vs. specialization conversation. While this most likely depends on individual aims, abilities, and ambitions, I'm a big fan of generalization. Not generalization for generalization's sake, but an intentional expansion of what's possible, not just not but in the future. The broader approach allows for unintended inspiration. It enables you to future-proof yourself. It also gives more relevancy to the specialized knowledge you already have. Some of my best insights about marketing came from: the creations of artists the studies of scientists the lives of political leaders the stories of writers Lateral thinking helps build a practical framework to adapt to a more complex, interconnected world."}
