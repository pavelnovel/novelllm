Seeing how AI innovation is rippling through industries and creative work has also been fascinating to witness and be a part of. To that end ... I'm thrilled to share a new show we've launched: Marketers Talking AI. Every Thursday here on LinkedIn, Jess Bahr and I are going Live and chatting about marketing and AI, where it's at, and where it's going. We got some interesting perspectives, new takes, and useful resources we'll be sharing. [Fun fact: we co-hosted a daily podcast about ten years ago called Internet Pandas, covering the intersection of the internet and society. So Marketeres Talking AI is, in fact, the 2nd show we're co-hosting together.] So every Thursday at 1:15 PM ET. Drop in, brings questions, and bring friends."}
