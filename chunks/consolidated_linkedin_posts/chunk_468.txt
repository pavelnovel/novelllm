Normally, much of what influencer agencies did were the logistics of discovering and managing those influencers. That will still be a thing, and doing that better will create a more effective and impactful campaign for the brand. Tighter operations, shorter turnaround times, and extra communication with the influencers (and brand) are all part of an operational discipline that can be designed. Another differential is incorporating the influencer across more layers of marketing. Currently, many influencer-brand relationships are very one-sided and one-dimensional. Influencer agencies that figure out new sides and new dimensions will continue to thrive and add value."}
