I submit one prompt and get back two different LLM outputs, side-by-side. The site’s built around voting on which response is better (that’s how those popular LLM leaderboards are created), but the real benefit for me is getting two AI brains working on a problem instantly and for free. I’ve also discovered some fantastic models I wouldn’t have found otherwise (either experimental ones, or beta ones). Worth checking out if you're playing with prompts and want to see a couple of takes quickly."}
