Some of my favorites: “Trying for theme is important, however you won’t see what the story is about until you’re at the end of the story. Got it? Now rewrite.” (Reminds me of how a brand will evolve over time) “Why must you tell this story in particular? What’s the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That’s the heart of it.” (What’s your unfair advantage?) “Putting it on paper only allows you to start fixing it. If a perfect idea stays in your head, you’ll never share it with anyone” (Create, create, create!)"}
