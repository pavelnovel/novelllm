It’s not a getting there, more of a (be)coming here. This past week I’ve been reminded over and over that life can change in an instant. This can be both good and bad. The reminders for me came in the form of close calls and my children, but the reminders can take form in any way for any reason. Listen to the intuition, it has guided a great many people before us. Take care of your mind and body. As Stephen Covey often wrote, sharpen the saw. Belief comes before ability, so culminate the self-belief and empower the imagination. And following Churchill’s advice, ALWAYS MORE AUDACITY."}
