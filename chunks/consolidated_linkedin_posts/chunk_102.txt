I've been consciously moving my mindset and energy away from Outcome, and towards Process. I view entrepreneurship as a way to build new relationships with people, to solve complex real-world puzzles, and to discover myself and the world. I view marketing as a way to tell stories, to get people excited, and to champion ideals and values I believe in. I view consulting as a way to help people and broaden their perspectives, to share my unique gifts and insights, and to learn new things from other people with their own unique gifts and insights to share. I do all the things I do because I enjoy them, and because they're fun & delightful. I'm a curious person who loves to explore the world around me, and all of these roles allow me to experience these things to a deeper level. When you're in it for the long-run, it helps to have fun along the way."}
