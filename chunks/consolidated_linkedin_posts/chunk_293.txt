I noticed that success is a scorecard of aesthetic. But aesthetic itself is a scorecard of something else, specifically culture. The culture creates the coheision, espeically when it's consistent. The aesthetic emerges out of that consistency. And it's important to note: aesthetic isn't only a \"visual\" thing, as in design and style. Something can look clean and modern, but lack aesthetic. This is because aesthetic is something that reveals itself over time, which is why consistency and constancy are important. Can you build towards aesthetic? No, but you can built intentionally towards culture and a unique worldview."}
