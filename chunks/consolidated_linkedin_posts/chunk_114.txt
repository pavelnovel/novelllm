Move beyond thinking in terms of consumption, purchases, transactions. Lead by example by being original and creative. Support artists and the communities around around them. No one wants to CONSUME more. All we do is consume. We’ve been a consumer culture for like a whole century. And now we are also consuming information, consuming from a FEED no less. People are dying to create, and to be noticed and supported for their creation. Use your marketing to empower and champion that. In a real way too. Not on some “use our hashtag” ish. Literally there’s over $120 billion dollars being spent on digital ads annually. 99% of it is completely from a “consume more” perspective. To what end?"}
