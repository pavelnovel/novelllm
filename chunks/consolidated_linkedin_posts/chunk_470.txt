Some takeaways that stood out: 1. How different everything is! These ads span decades, so there's a medley of aesthetics, cultural references, and approaches that these agencies and brands took. 2. Humor is great. Many ads here could only have come from brands (and corresponding agencies) who didn't take themselves so SERIOUSLY. 3. The timelessness of great ads transcends eras. There's some great ads from the 1980s (particularly an iconic ad in the top 10) that still reflect today's values."}
