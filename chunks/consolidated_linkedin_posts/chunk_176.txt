There was a ridiculous article on Guardian that talked about how Juicero is a sign that America is anti-innovation and it's a sign that America is \"refusing to break new ground.\" There's so much more to Silicon Valley and the innovation therein (see article for a more detailed outline). It's easy to look at a $400 juicer and scoff. However, as the article points out: \"So I would recommend people stop talking about how Silicon Valley only makes ridiculous overpriced juicers. It’s not that it doesn’t make those. It does, just like everywhere else. A Facebook friend pointed out that QVC has been selling our parents ridiculous overpriced kitchen items since before we were born. Billy Mays pitched the EZ Crunch Bowl, which promised to “revolutionize your cereal-eating experience”. The unique thing about Silicon Valley isn’t that it’s got overpriced status goods designed to separate rich people from their money. The unique thing about Silicon Valley is that it’s got anything else.\""}
