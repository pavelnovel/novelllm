We've got great feedback for our AI content generation tool and our approach. We're blending various LLMs, giving them web access, and ensuring everything aligns with brand guidelines and the custom target personas. The more the system learns from the feedback, the more it adapts and evolves. We're working on exciting features for our roadmap, like generating images from scratch using Midjourney. Currently, we're acing long-form articles over 2,000 words, but we're also expanding to new channels and formats, including social posts and emails. We're opening up access for a software-only, lower-priced tier that forgoes the human-in-the-loop element. If you're a founder, a marketer, or just someone curious about implementing more AI in your marketing, let's connect!"}
