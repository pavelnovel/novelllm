I always questioned it as it never fully made any sense, both strategically and morally. Today, society & culture have progressed where most marketers don't think to that (although every industry has an underbelly where I'm sure it's still a thought). I wonder what sort of marketing perspective/thought that's accepted today would be \"wrong\" in 15 years. Whether because the larger society progressed, or the zeitgeist of marketing has shifted. I think we'll stop peddling youth as much (especially as the population continues to grow older, and also try to curb the prevalent age discrimination). Another phrase I've often heard is \"perception is reality\" in marketing conversations, and that's going to be a less provocative thought. With where the world is going with augmentation, metaverses, and avatars, it'll be more like \"reality is perception.\" I can't think of any others right now, but if you have any, drop them in the comments."}
