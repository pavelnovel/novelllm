I'm using the last half hour of the day to write to keep my streak going. I've always \"done\" challenges and streaks, throughout the last 12 years, in how I've structured my life and personal development. Streaks for meditation, journaling, working out, deep work, and every other great habit you'll read about in an article on Medium. Until one day, two years ago, a conversation with my therapist sparked a fascinating self-reflection. My mind always returns to the quote commonly attributed to Jerry Seinfeld, about writing a joke and never breaking the chain. It's digestible, but it's short-singed. I've over-applied them to myself, not realizing they don't suffice every person the same way. Much like one, same workout routine or exercise doesn't apply at maximum to all persons. For me, what has helped the most has been breaking streaks, and doing it without judgment, allowing my return without friction. Without feeling stuck to the streak, but stuck to the outcome. Never is an unrealistic word. Rather have trust in returning to a habit than trusting in never breaking. That's literally the long game. This approach helped me have more peace in my life. Plus, the challenge of writing every day for 90 days has been great in and of itself. Writing has always drawn me in; now I know I'm a writer, because I'm doing the writing thing. LinkedIn seemed like the best public platform for me, with the ideas shared and resonated here. So here I am, streaking away."}
