That’s because meaningful, deep work must be resistant to impulses that pull away from that purpose and those gifts. Being able to articulate the purpose that we serve becomes essential in keeping us connected to it. Writing it out helps tremendously. Also, repetition helps create new grooves in our thinking mind around it. Obviously, all of this is easier said than done. It’s one thing to write a post on it, and another to practice it, day in and day out. Especially when sometimes things get dark and hopeless. (At least that’s how my mental health works.) But that’s okay too. Every new day and every new moment is an opportunity to re-affirm. Have compassion on yourself. Start again. And be ready to start again, and again, and again."}
