It's easy to track vanity metrics, but you need to focus on the metrics that really show marketing's impact, like revenue, bookings, and pipeline. Not impressions or social media followers. (easier said than done, trust me, I know) If you can't tie metrics to financial value, question their usefulness, but don't throw necessarily throw it out. What can't be measured can still be managed. Don't avoid impactful marketing activities just because their effects are difficult to quantify precisely. Use estimates, tie metrics to financial value as best you can, and track performance over time. The alternative is potentially missing opportunities and undervaluing the role of marketing. Measure when you can, but don't be limited by metrics alone."}
