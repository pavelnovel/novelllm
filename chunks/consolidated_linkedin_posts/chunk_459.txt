I'd listened to it after I'd also finished listening to Isaacson's biographies of Albert Einstein and Leonardo Da Vinci. So you can say this was a biography trilogy I decided to do. It was a lot of hours in the last 2+ months. I feel like I went on some journey. First, it immersed me in considering the bigger picture. Through those biographies, I traveled through the 1500s, 1700s, and 1900s. These people's lives were so touched by global events that each of their stories was a time capsule of the world. I'm working on a longer set of takeaways from reading/listening to these three tomes, but here are some immediate things that jumped out: 1) Life is so unpredictable. It only makes sense after the life is lived, and even then, the thread of life revealed has many loose ends that knot it up. That's how we get complex people. It's easy to generalize and place Da Vinci in the \"genius\" category and move on, but the genius is only found in the nuances. 2) Opportunities are always presenting themselves. Opportunities to try, express, ask, create, etc. Many of them went unrealized, and that's fine; they just kept going for the next one. 3) Each of these historical icons was surrounded by many other amazing people, albeit those with less exposure. Those people left essential marks on the world and led fulfilling lives. Being remembered by history is a fluke. 4) There's no playbook. 5) In addition to successes, their stories were also beset with failure. They faced ridicule and rejection, as did/does everyone else. And sometimes, they let it get them down. 6) A tangible feeling that these were very real, very human people, and that's cool. They weren't historical caricatures with a shallow punchline."}
