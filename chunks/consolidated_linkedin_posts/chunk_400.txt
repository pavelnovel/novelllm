Professionals seeking opportunities and connections aren’t going anywhere 3. B2B marketing needs (and budgets) aren’t going anywhere (and that’s not to make a blanket statement that LinkedIn can’t work for B2C). LinkedIn has built a dominant moat. There’s massive value in embracing it. I started taking it seriously about a month ago in terms of publishing content and using it as a platform to share my insights that I usually share in private with clients & collaborators. I don’t have a perfect LinkedIn strategy, and I never will. But the best strategy was in starting. As silly as it sounds, for a while, I felt as though I was “too late.” (Never let the feeling of “too late” hold you back). So far, it’s been great. I know it’s a long game, but just the process of getting comfortable with writing and publishing has had its rewards. I still love me some Instagram. I still love TikTok (both from a consumption and creation standpoint). And I still love me some Tumblr the most. (Fun fact, I’ve been a loooong-time Tumblr user and have seen it through all its evolutions. There’s something absolutely magical to it. More on all of that another time). But when it comes to building the Work-side of my life, where I get to be the best Entrepreneur, Puzzle-solver, and Consultant, and Knowledge/Creative Worker in the 21st Century, Anno Domini, LinkedIn is most definitely where it’s at."}
