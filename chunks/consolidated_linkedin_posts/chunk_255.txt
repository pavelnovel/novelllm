Let’s not forget the tools that have been with us for decades, that got us through so many disruptions. You know the ones I’m talking about. Some good ol’ fashioned water tools. Funnels. Marketers can’t stop talking about those. Pipelines. Buckets. Drips. Get these right and you’re right as rain. Makes sense though. These tools for moving water highlight the flowing, dynamic nature of marketing. (Workflows, anyone?) But why stop there? Give me straws. Pumps. Water mills. Watering cans. Ice cube trays. The possibilities are endless."}
