Also, check the comments for my favorite free word-editing tool.] • phrases like \"next-level\" are too vague of adverbs to be compelling. If you're going to use adverbs, ensure they're powerful and push your sentence along • other cliches like \"start-to-finish\" don't add distinctions to the copy. If you see this in your writing, use it as an opportunity to elaborate on what the start and finish actually is. It can be as simple as adding one or two words. The extra descriptions show the reader that you know the process well enough to explain it. • words like \"nearby\" and \"local\" may be synonyms, but they convey different meanings. \"nearby\" communicates convenience; \"local\" expresses community. • sometimes, communicating a benefit can harm brand perception. You can assume certain benefits. An extreme example: I don't want poison in my bottled water. But I'd be wary about purchasing the bottled water that has a big sticker that says \"without poison.\" Were any of these tips useful? Stay sharp."}
