Then, you have to film yourself jumping through them. It’s called Hoops. All the top influencers are doing it. . . . . . In all seriousness, though. This triad of Instagram the Brand, creators/influencers, and advertisers is an endless drama of plate-spinning and hoop-jumping, with everyone trying to survive. Every action in this marketplace has endless ripples, with new complaints and opportunities. Creators jump through hoops at every algorithm change and new trick for engagement. Instagram jumps through hoops to keep engagement growing and attract brand advertisers. Advertisers jump through hoops trying to grow their brand with increased competition, lowered budgets, and a more discerning consumer. These plates keep spinning as long as you keep spinning them. No one wants to break plates. PS - Remember that other motives are at play when the biggest criticisms of the recent IG changes come from established accounts. Billions upon billions of dollars have moved through the Facebook advertising chain, and there are much larger forces in the undercurrents. Instagram is in a no-win situation (seeing that they have already “won,” all you can do is maintain that W). Can they steal from TikTok to innovate for a new generation? Or will they continue to fade slowly? Find out in the next episode of the world."}
