And almost in the same breath, new developments and trends showed otherwise. (This year, we're squarely in the LONG LIVE EMAIL! camp) Email will never die. The Internet now as we know it is not the Internet how it was conceived to be. Instead, the average user's experience of the Internet is mainly through a bubble of social media, guarded by monopolies and their algorithms. On the other hand, email operates over servers and protocols without a need for a company to control the flow of information. While there are a wide variety of mail client applications that allow you to interface with those servers and protocols, at the core of it, email is an open framework, very much unlike social media. Email is the closest regular experience people have of \"The Internet.\" The openness and decentralized nature of the email framework will always operate in tandem with walled gardens, which will inevitably pop up. (The profit motive is $trong) After all, you need an email address to make any account! Email and these walled communities are the heads and tails of the coin that is the Internet. It's a pendulum that swings in which marketers and media go back and forth between embracing the different sides."}
