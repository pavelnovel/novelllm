Facebook cemented in our minds the idea of a \"social network.\" Social networks as a business or interaction model didn't have a collective understanding 20 years ago. It took a few decades to give a strong enough sense of what a social network company is, to then be able to say \"hey we're not that thing.\" The idea of \"social network\" also gave other words into our language, mainly by shifting their meaning. Most notably \"friend.\" Within the framework of \"social network,\" Friend took on a new meaning, both as a noun and as a verb. I am curious to see what a shift towards these \"entertainment networks\" mediated by algorithms will do to our language. What new words and concepts will be introduced into our parlance?"}
