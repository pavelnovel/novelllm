Layers piques Curiosity, the drive to dig deeper. This PULLS customers through a journey, rather than PUSHES. No one wants to be pushed in life. We want to be pulled as if we're dancing, as if it's a mutual, collaborative exploration of this journey we call Life, with the rest of the world. The layers of the brand story allow the experience to sink in. Let the story absorb through all those touch-points, and see-points and hear-points, because the the goal is immersion. Stories of deep impact and meaning through many layers become timeless and transcendent. It's this timelessness that builds brands."}
