All I know from 12 years of entrepreneurship is that there's never a moment when it's all done and final. Nothing is ever fully figured out. The good thing, though, is everything is figureouteable (h/t to Marie Forleo for this great word). This is especially true in marketing, when everything around shifts and turns. Markets, technologies, needs, and desire, all in flux and flow. It's (dare I say) fun to be able to figure out things on the operations side, on positioning, and on overall strategy. It's a winding road, that winds up looping back into itself, and the goal is to not run out of wind."}
