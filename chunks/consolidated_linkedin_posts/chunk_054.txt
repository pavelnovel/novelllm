Not because of similarities of the deal structure or potential prospects for TikTok's continued success, but because of the unexpected marriage of a hot social media platform and legacy tech business. At no point (especially from their CEO's conversation early on) did it seem that one day Tumblr will be owned by Verizonâ€”but there it happened. And at no point did I imagine 12 months ago that somehow Oracle would be running the hottest social media platform in America. That's 2020 for you. I am curious too what sorts of conversations went on in those rooms"}
