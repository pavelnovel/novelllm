Because creators have been the source of the Internet as we know it, and platforms can't exist without creators on it. You can't have a network without nodes. And when I say creators, I mean anyone that has created anything. This even includes that post of someone's lunch to a random observation about pop culture. Anything you see on the Internet has been written, or photographed, or recorded by someone. And that someone is the creator. The billions of dollars that have been pledged to creators from dozens of companies sound like it's a lot. But it's a drop in the bucket of the supply chain of data and attention that has delivered trillions of dollars in value. The creator funds are a start though. The other thing to keep an eye on will be the allocation of all those funds. The determination of who gets it will almost always be guided by an overarching benefit back to the platform. Basic conditioning through rewards. You want more videos on your platform? Give the rewards to those people making videos."}
