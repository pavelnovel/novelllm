Partnerships build momentum and buzz. Heat spreads when atoms vibrate next to each other. Energy bubbles up and out. Physical law and natural law. Nothing succeeds in a vacuum or in isolation. The easiest community to tap into are your customers, but don’t treat them like a cash cow. The more connections the brand makes, the easier it is to stay top of mind. Magic happens when these connections reinforce each other. That’s the power of the (eco)system."}
