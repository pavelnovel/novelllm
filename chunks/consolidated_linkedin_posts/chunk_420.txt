It helps to avoid passive writing, reduce adverbs, and simplify complex sentences. Great for effective copywriting. As a side note, Ernest Hemingway is one of my favorite writers. His writing is big on simplicity, directness, and economy of words. Read his \"Old Man and the Sea\" for some great (short) fiction. It was his last major work and my top 5 fiction novels."}
