The classic example in business of this is an endless price-based competition, where competitors keep trying to undercut each other’s profit until profit margins dwindle and sustainable growth disappears for everyone involved. There are other examples that happen too often: Over-relying on discounts and promotions. Businesses may rely too much on discounts and promotions to drive sales, creating a culture of customer expectation for low prices, potentially reducing customer loyalty, and undermining the value of the product. (Remember, price can be a strong signal of value.) Blindly optimizing for lower cost-per-anything (clicks, acquisitions, etc.). If the quality of the click or acquisition is ignored, guess what? You’re racing to the bottom against the algorithm Under-investing in creative. This may mean trying to get cheaper visuals for ads, not getting enough images for a website, or using basic stock videos. If you’re planning to spend 50k in ads, it’s well worth investing at least 20% of that into high-quality creative that will help differentiate the business against competitors. The money “saved” on creative will undermine the whole marketing. Under-investing in promotion. If you’re planning to do an event, are running a big giveaway, or are paying professionals to do creative, make sure you’re also investing in advertising. It’s disheartening to see brands spend $$$ on great video, only for it to go nowhere. Remember, you and your business are playing the long game. Avoid becoming a commodity. Don’t race to the bottom. Getting to the top involves investing energy and money into differentiating your business. Build those profit margins. Grow that market share. Build customer loyalty and make your customers feel like they made the wise decision."}
