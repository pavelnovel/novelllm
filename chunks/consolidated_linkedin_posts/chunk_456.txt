Noticing (and labeling) these steps along this feedback loop goes a long toward breaking cycles of stress, anxiety, and dread that lock us into inaction. On the flip side, the emotion of Hope and Possibility (as opposed to Fear) also has a feedback loop of thoughts, behaviors, and sensations. We can cultivate those emotions through thoughts of Gratitude, movement (even as simple as sitting up straight), and other behavior that get us moving forward."}
