My 11-year-old sister first told me about it two months ago, but I kind of ignored it (love you though, keep feeding me what the these Gen Alpha kids are doing). Once I played it yesterday, I see what the hype is about. More importantly, I’m seeing the social dynamics at play when it comes to the game. The appeal of the game has nothing to do with graphics or “realism”. Instead, it’s in the social collaboration aspect of it. The entire game dynamic is built on perception, group communication, and an eye for spotting unnatural behavior. And boy oh boy are those are important skills to have in an age of bots and fake information."}
