Little attention is given to building relationships with existing customers to expand the ecosystem, and investing in a strong brand that with time will lower those new customer acquisition costs, among many other benefits. The reason for this myopic view is because many startups live and die by their ability to secure investment. And many of these investors & VCs judge these companies on the nominal customer growth and acquisition. As a result, these companies work to acquire as many new customers at the lowest costs to woo investors, especially right before seeking the investment, without much thought to where they're coming from or the long-term relationships with these customers. Too often, these new customers wind up being one-time customers, without any emotional investment in the brand to spread the word in any way. This creates an endless cycle of acquiring new customers without a strategy to keep them, leading to churn. On a more macro scale, this also creates a cycle of VCs investing in startups that don't have much of a marketing strategy beyond customer acquisition, which over time puts those VCs in the same predicament of churn. What are you doing to break the cycle?"}
