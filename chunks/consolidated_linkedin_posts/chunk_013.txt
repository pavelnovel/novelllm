With the recent Facebook whistleblower appearing on '60 Minutes' and the InstaFace outage on Monday, Facebook once again captured the imagination of how it'll crumble. People relish in the fall from grace. We've been conditioned to look for it, to prophesize it. Today especially, where doom-and-gloom conversations are common, it seems like we're just waiting around for any collapse. We then pick it apart post-mortem like vultures. (Ozy Media being a recent juicy morsel.) But here's the thing, rarely does the fall happen like that. From companies to civilizations, the demise is slow, gradual. The way history is taught creates a perception that everything has a clean ending. The year that it started, the year that it fell. All neatly bookmarked. But that's not the messy reality of Reality. Same thing with Facebook. The whistleblower and the outage on Monday show bits and pieces, all falling and crumbling. None too obvious. There won't be a Fallâ€”instead, it's a Falling. And it is already here. To the late-comers and willful deniers, there are still a few good years left, of course, so let's make the most of it, but step up the email, influencers/creators, and customer community. The smart media mavens and marketers who've made their bones on Facebook have already begun to venture out. The life of a platform nomad goes on."}
