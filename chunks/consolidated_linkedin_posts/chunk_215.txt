It's such a different world. Notably, there's a lack of today's big apps. No Instagram, no Netflix. Pandora was the top music app; no Spotify yet. Youtube wasn't an app yet. Look at Skype there, too, making the top 10 way before Zoom. It's a good reminder of how much things change and orders shift. The business models were so different, too. Looking at this 2011 list, very few had any subscription model. I sometimes forget how monumental the introduction and normalization of subscription models were. The shift from paying per song to paying for streaming a la Apple Music to Spotify's model. Ownership to access. The explosion of mobile led that shift. That was built on top of the hardware developments and physical innovations (such as the introduction of 3G). I'm curious to see what new business models and paradigms emerge with the speedy spread of AI. What new pricing and business models will become the norm? What new customer expectations will be established?"}
