It's a marketing book, but not a typical one. No case studies. No playbooks. Instead, it's an exploration of perspectives: how we see markets, how markets see us, and how these views shape everything in between. This book is an invitation to see things differently. Not to be right, but to discover new possibilities in this ancient profession. Coming soon. More perspectives to follow."}
