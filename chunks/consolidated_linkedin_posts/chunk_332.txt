I'm trying to spend more of my weekends not looking at screens (ironically, typing this on my laptop on a weekend). Overall, there's tremendous value to intentional, regular breaks for knowledge workers. This broadly includes workers, freelancers, founders, influencers. \"Intentional\" because this should be under your own volition. \"Regular\" because taking a break is a practice and skill, and you need repetition to improve. Why should you get good at taking breaks? You give your mind time to digest and ferment the snippets of thought into a thread that can provide a lot value. Step away from a screen and allow thoughts to wander, to return to our work with renewed energy, fresh perspectives, a Have you ever wondered why shower thoughts are so common? I guess it'd be because when we're in the shower, our minds KNOW that we can't or won't be able to do any work-related tasks. No notifications can come in, and no thought can be easily captured or acted upon. Our brain surrenders into just letting the thoughts pass over us, with ideas and mental alerts (reminders that pop up in our minds) washing through like the water. It's like a force meditation. And from a lighter mental state, new thoughts can break free when we loosen our tightened minds. When to take intentional, regular breaks? Lunch is an easy, regualr time to bake a break into. Maybe a 5-10 minute walk after lunch before hopping back into work. Evenings is a good time. Try to give a break/gap between sleep and the end of work, even just an hour. Do you notice any change in work quality when you do and don't take breaks?"}
