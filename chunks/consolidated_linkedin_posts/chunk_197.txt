I can now use their built-in AI to write up Airtable formulas. And for those who don’t know, Airtable formulas are magical, and you can do such amazing things with them. (To really leverage them, combine with custom Views and their workflows to automate EVERYTHING. Anywhooo) Airtable’s initial offering with the AI was okay, nothing special. The AI formula writing is a great example of implementing AI in a very specific and practical way inside of a tool. Before, I’ve been using ChatGPT to write Airtable formulas (and scripts). [I will share some of my examples of the ChatGPT chats in the comments] And before ChatGPT, I just had different formulas that worked well that I hoarded in a Notion doc like some sort of Formula junkie. It’s kind of the equivalent of lugging around a case of CDs back in the 90s, but then streaming and cloud come around and you don’t need to do that anymore. You can just pull up what you need. This is what their AI feature can now allow."}
