(AIM is AOL Instant Messenger, for those who don't know) AIM crawled so Slack can run. So what's next? In 10 years, all the kids who used Roblox growing up will be in their 20s, working in the metaverse with all their remote coworkers. It'll be called something like Fruffle, and it'll be to Roblox what Slack is to Aim. Roblox (for those who don't know) is a massive multiplayer game environment where you can create, play, and socialize as this little avatar. Roblox is not just a game but more of a place to hang out while playing. (Think of it as what the arcade was like 40 years ago.) Do you remember your first AIM screen name? I'll drop mine in the comments."}
