I have too many plans, strategies, and frameworks I've developed, proofed, and improved in there. I'd love to be able to reference back and work in. (Basically, I use the chats as living, working doc) 2. Ability to collaborate (ideally in realtime) with colleagues in a chat. 3. Ability to add reminders into the chats so that they would surface later at a specified time. At least give me the ability to Pin them! This is where a lot of the AI usability improvements for knowledge workers will come in the future. (after the gimmicky one-time generation capability). Currently, the experience of using AI is too individualized and isolated in time. I want my conversations to live across space and time."}
