There was research that showed links to stress and anxiety. Additionally, there is a growing understanding of the adverse outcomes and costs associated with loneliness. These include fractured communities, declining trust, stress, depression, and disease. Over this summer, even with lockdowns, it feels that we have gone into a positive direction around lessening the sense of loneliness. There's a more shared feeling of dealing with a difficult task together. People are finding new ways to stay connected. Voices and communities are being heard. More than ever, we recognize our collective & connected power in making a difference, whether its to \"stop the spread\" or remind the world that Black Lives Matter. Urban loneliness is a phenomenon that has existed and will continue to exist. It's part of the existential crisis of being alive, living with millions of other people. But through it all, there's always room for optimism and a renewal of faith in the human spirit."}
