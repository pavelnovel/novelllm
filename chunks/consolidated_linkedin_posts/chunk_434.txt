Individuals in a larger context have interrelationships of values, ideals, and goals, and these become the grooves through which marketing can flow. Any factor regarding how something looks or makes a person feel emerges through this communal, collective conversation. When marketers talk about features vs. values, this is where the values come from. In other words, the value of something doesn't come from a vacuum, or an individual detached from the world. The community is what creates a sense of belonging and meaning. It opens up opportunities for growth (because growth only happens in relation to something else). It creates aspirations and heroes. Without this \"gap\" of what is vs. what could be, marketing as is won't work. Storytelling builds marketing, and these stories get us from one place to another. This place we're going to is guided on a path set by community. Also, \"community\" doesn't need to be a rigidly defined group with boundaries. It's not a list of your customers or sign-ups. It's not your social following. A community isn't static; instead, it's a dynamism that emerges from the combined interactions and interconnections among the group, always in flow. Marketing speaks within this framework. Effective marketing leverages this framework to build a beacon for the community to build around."}
