The more that a system is interconnected, the more resilient, more efficient, and more effective it is in delivering outcomes. Marketing is the same way. When you understand this reality of marketing, it's a lot easier to then see why marketing focused on going deeper outperforms going broader. It's easier to understand why multiple touchpoints and multiple channels become imperative to create awareness and engagement.
