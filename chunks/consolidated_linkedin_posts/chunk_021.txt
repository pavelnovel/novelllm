Because much of the impact from using the Super Bowl as a marketing channel is to create a collective awareness of w/e is being advertised. (known as common knowledge) The Super Bowl ad price is not just a matter of reach or impressions, as comparable to a media buy on digital. To coordinate mass action, you need is to let others know that others know about the product. Awareness of awareness. Things like this can only be done on a mass scale like a Super Bowl, where you know that (many many) other people are watching and paying attention. \"I know that you know that she knows\" is a lot more powerful than simply \"I know\" â€” thus the $6.5M price tag set for a spot on America's biggest public ritual of media spectacle."}
