I love reading on that because network effects are fundamentally systems in action. Systems inspire me. Systems are how nature works, from our bodies to the planet. Somewhere in-between are companies and startups. It's fascinating to think about how systems work. For example, how the overall system affects one part, which in turn creates an effect that influencers the overall system, which then influences all the parts, forever onwards. These things are constantly in flux, and it's systems within systems. Turtles all the way down. Your supply chain, customer community, and social media platforms are all systems within systems, all interacting in imprecise and minute ways. The whole thing can be so mind-boggling to think about if you consider all the layers. That is why thinking in systems is such a competitive advantage. It helps bring to life why network effects, community, and partnerships are so powerful and how they will continue to impact everything from product design to marketing to hiring. There's no facet of business that's outside a system. Designing and operating within a system helps be adaptable and flexible and helps uncover new opportunities. And we need adaptability and flexibility more than ever."}
