It's probably not a very popular opinion, but I'm generally apathetic to Google's shift towards SGE (Search Generative Experience) and how it'll impact publishers in the form of less web traffic. (As a user, I actually love SGE. I generally don't like having to browse through different websites for an answer, unless I'm doing a deep dive into a topic.) It's an apathy I generally feel about larger platforms that aggregate web traffic and when they shift their algorithms or output. These platforms never needed to exist. Search traffic didn't even need to happen. It all came about by collective innovation, and it all took one route in the form of Search that many publishers today know and love. And that's going to change. Because all things change. Google didn't come to be to safeguard a regular stream of traffic for SEO-optimized websites. That was a nice by-product for many companies. I get that there's a lot of Uncertainty that publishers are feeling. And that's a normal state of affairs that every entrepreneur, freelancer, and team has to deal with at some point. It's fine; the wave of uncertainty will pass. The people creating interesting and good content (by whatever metric we want to measure that by) will continue to garner attention and headspace. Something new will be innovated into existence. Something else will change. And we will back to stasis."}
