It works in almost mysterious ways, and I've witnessed it COUNTLESS of times in my own life and others. Seemingly out-of-nowhere one inbound lead somehow becomes three. One client becomes four. One nomination brings two more. One press mention begets three. Not to get too esoteric (because believe me I can) but somehow these actions excite, energize, and magnetize each other. And on the flip side, there are going to be droughts; which is the \"negative\" side of the when it rains it pours principle. But when there's a drought, and it starts to rain, you can bet that it's going to pour. Have you noticed these patterns in your work recently?"}
