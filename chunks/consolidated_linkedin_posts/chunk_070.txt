Super out-of-this-world, visually immersive experience. It really pushed the boundary of what live digital concerts/events can and will be. Really made me forget for a second I was in quarantine... Love what Fortnite’s been doing in creating a whole new world. So many possibilities emerging of what it means to create an experience. I caught the first show but there’s gonna be 4 more shows happening over the next 2 days. The remaining show schedule: Friday 4/24 - 10AM EDT Saturday 4/25 - 12AM EDT Saturday 4/25 - 11AM EDT Saturday 4/25 - 6PM EDT"}
