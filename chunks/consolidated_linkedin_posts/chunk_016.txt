This isn’t a comparison of the types of work, but a similarity between them in how the two classes emerged within their new economies. The working class mainly emerged with the Industrialization of the economy. A collective consciousness took root, which resulted in clashes and upheavals against the larger systems of the organization of labor (factories, monopolies, companies, etc.). Much of it I’m simplifying, but Engels and Marx go more in-depth with it. Today, there’s a burgeoning collective consciousness of being a creator within the Internetization of the economy. Similar upheavals are happening, with a widespread emergence of unions for freelance writers, influencers, and other creators. Also, we are seeing collective resistance and creator boycotts (which have their own root as a class against a larger system of harassment and discrimination). There’s a common thread of pushback against the exploitation of labor/creativity, monopolization of platforms/profits, and collective organization as resistance. The other interesting parallel is that there had to be laws against child labor, barring children from working in mines and factories. Today, especially with recent leaks about the psychological effects on teens, we see a similar pushback against Facebook and their efforts to introduce Instagram for Kids. Do we need to update our child labor laws? Funny how the more things change, the more they stay the same."}
