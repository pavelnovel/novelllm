{"timestamp": "2022-07-28 21:46:37", "text": "\"Angels can fly because they can take themselves lightly.\" This is one of my favorite quotes. It came from G.K. Chesterton, and reading further from the source, I came across this deeper nugget: \"Seriousness is not a virtue...seriousness is a vice. It is really a... lapse into taking one's self gravely, because it is the easiest thing to do... For solemnity flows out of men naturally; but laughter is a leap. It is easy to be heavy: hard to be light. Satan fell by the force of gravity.\" Take yourself lightly. There's a sense of a playful, Zen-like detachment in this. Lift the barriers to joy and presence; let it flow into your personal and professional life. Fill yourself with laughter from the depths of your spirit. Because... why not?"}
