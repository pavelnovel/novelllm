{"timestamp": "2020-04-22 03:08:02", "text": "There's a lot of talk about \"return to normal\" and \"new normal.\" Normal is an illusion. Normal is a bucketful of water scooped from a rushing river; you won't get the same bucket twice. While the magnitude and scale of change vary (and thus our conscious awareness of it), change is constant. 2020 was going to bring new things regardless. Organizations and people would have been called to adapt to new realities, whatever they were. It just so happens that the big Change now is a pandemic. Don't get lulled by or pine for a sense of a constant, unchanging existence. Our global hyper-connectedness lives won't allow for such a static world. I'm reminded of Octavia's Butler's words in her Earthseed trilogy, in which she described Earthseed, a fictional new religion, based on the tenet that: \"All that you touch You Change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth Is Change. God Is Change.\" Remember, you're doing well. Keep going."}
