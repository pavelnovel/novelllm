Hey friend,

Labor Day is today, and it's a great day to reflect on the holiday's 130-year history in America (since it became a federal holiday in 1894) and the evolving role of labor in our society. As we look back, we see how the meaning of "labor" has transformed and is inextricably linked to the tools and technologies we use as a society.

The Creep of Labor into Our Homes
A noticeable shift has been the “where” of labor. For a long time, labor meant another place—the "workplace" as separate from home. Yet, with the rise of remote work, the separation is blurred.

Labor has entered our living rooms, kitchens, and even our conversations. Work-from-home borders on live-from-office. Terms like “emotional labor” have become part of our daily lexicon, illustrating how work-related language dominates even our personal lives. Daily on-demand conveniences like delivery and transportation are built on an increasing workforce of on-demand labor. We’re surrounded by labor.

The Creep of Labor into (and out of) Our Minds
Today’s labor would be unrecognizable to workers of the past, not because we as humans have evolved, but because our tools and technologies have. As French philosopher Jacques Ellul wrote, la technique—the drive for efficiency—has become an autonomous force, shaping every aspect of our lives, including our concept of labor. Labor has increasingly become a mental process happening in the imagination, governed by the relentless push for efficiency that la technique demands.


The term “knowledge work” was first introduced by management consultant Peter Drucker in 1959 in his book The Landmarks of Tomorrow. For knowledge workers, labor is about generating ideas, solving mental problems, and synthesizing information to create insights. While the term still applies, our forward march toward artificial intelligence will need a new term for the new category of work.

Labor in a Time of Generative AI
AI's mass emergence in the workforce forces us to grapple with new definitions of knowledge, productivity, and creativity.

The knowledge assets that Drucker predicted would overtake as the primary assets of the economy will continue to grow. The growth picked up when the Internet effectively reduced the distribution cost to zero.

Now, as the marginal cost of generating ideas approaches zero as well, the challenge is understanding how we value both the thought of labor and the labor of thought.

The Unpaid Elephant in the Room
An inconvenient truth is society’s eternal love for unpaid labor. This is equally true in the context of AI. Much of today’s AI development is built on the unpaid labor of writers, content creators, and users whose data and content have first fueled the growth of platforms.

These platforms are now reinvesting these growth gains into developing more advanced AI models, which need increasingly more training data (a nice euphemism for content from people).

I suspect we won’t have a resolution soon.

In this new landscape, what becomes valuable?

An analysis of labor must also consider the market dynamics of labor. This is not just the supply-demand of the laborers but also the supply-demand of the output of the labor—in our case, content.

Generation and consumption are inherently linked. (Although another piece to consider is that humans aren’t the only ones who’ll be consuming content, as the consumption of information by machines and bots already happens with what we call “crawling” and “training.”)

This shift forces us to reconsider what makes work valuable.

Future labor will likely prioritize:

Creativity that AI models won’t replicate

Strategic thought that guides AI systems

Networked intelligence that combines human insight with AI capabilities

Authenticity (original authorship) will also increasingly be valued. What does that mean for the knowledge worker? More presence and facetime. Tomorrow’s knowledge workers will blur the lines with today’s influencers and content creators.

Meaningful work will also be prioritized, both as producers and consumers. How does one fill work with meaning? Meaning can only arise from connecting two things, so the meaning is networked. Hence, networked intelligence is a new paradigm of work.


Networked intelligence
What now?
As we reflect on Labor Day and the journey of work over the past 130 years, it's clear that we stand at a pivotal moment in the history of labor. The lines between work and personal life have blurred, our minds have become our primary workplaces, and AI is reshaping the very nature of productivity and creativity.

In this new era, we're forced to grapple with fundamental questions:

How do we define and value labor when machines can generate ideas at scale?

What does it mean to be a knowledge worker when AI can process and synthesize information faster than any human?

And when does information become knowledge?

How do we ensure fair compensation in a world where unpaid labor fuels technological advancement? (This is an eternal question for all human societies)

The future of labor will likely belong to those who can harness creativity, strategic thought, and networked intelligence in ways that complement rather than compete with AI.

Until next Labor Day, may your work be meaningful and your efforts valued.
