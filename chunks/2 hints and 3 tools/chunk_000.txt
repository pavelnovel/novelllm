Everywhere you look, there's another AI success story: 'I used ChatGPT to code an app in 4 hours!' or 'This AI wrote my entire marketing strategy!' It's impressive, sure, but for most of us, it's not realistic. Nor is it actually effective, because if this stuff's so easy and accessible, shouldn't we all be drowning in killer apps and marketing made by AI?

Spoiler: We're not.

So are there any useful approaches to AI that an average knowledge or creative worker can use?

Two hints
Forget one-shot prompts
Ditch the idea of perfect prompts.

My approach to prompting has changed a lot since GPT-3 was introduced to the world in Nov 2022. I used to obsess over crafting the ideal prompt. I had a Google Doc collection of massive starting prompts that had all these placeholders for different parameters and contexts.

Now?

I write to AI like I'm DRUNK TEXTING. Misspellings, incomplete thoughts, and fragmented sentences.

I'll literally type stuff like "ga4 - reporting on page visits how to help me" to get the ball rolling. Why? Because I know I'll need to give the AI more feedback anyway. So why overload it (or myself) with a massive, "perfect" initial prompt?

Trust me, you'll get way more value from AI with a 10% effective prompt you actually use than a 100% effective prompt that's too complicated and unwieldy to bother with when you're in the thick of work.

My goal now? Get the right output on the 20th response, not the first. The magic happens in the back-and-forth iteration.

Learn tools in realtime
An under-reported value of AI is its ability to teach. There's a good reason AI is poised to make big advancements in education across all disciplines and levels. For professionals today, especially those knowledge workers, our day-to-day is a juggling act of different tools. Many companies today are built on tool stacks on top of tech stacks. Being able to leverage those tools effectively means you can do the work more effectively.

Enter AI.

Ever seen The Matrix? Remember when Neo just "learned" kung fu with a mind/file upload? That's what using AI to learn new tools feels like for me.

When I encounter a new software I haven’t used (whether it's actually new or just drastically redesigned), I just ask ChatGPT to show me how to do the thing I need to accomplish. If I need to build a report, run an operation, or perform any unfamiliar task with any SaaS tool, I just tell ChatGPT what I'm using and what I need.

It responds with a specific step-by-step guide of what I need to do. If I run into any issues in any step, I just ask for clarification. If I get any errors, I take a screenshot and ask how to fix it.

I've put this approach to the test in various scenarios, with great results.

I was able to teach myself how to use Google Analytics after their upgrade from Universal Analytics. I just asked enough questions on how to find different data and functions until it stuck. I learned to set up Python programs using Terminal without any coding knowledge in the same way. Through the help of AI, anyone can be an expert at any tool they have to use.

With AI, you're basically a SaaS Neo, just without the cool sunglasses and leather trench coat.

3 tools
I have a problem with most AI tool guides out there. They're full of undifferentiated, redundant, and frankly mediocre tools. Many of them are also just ChatGPT wrappers (meaning it's just ChatGPT integration on the backend with a prettier front-end and a fancy hat). And those lists with thousands of AI tools for sales and marketing are not useful for anyone genuinely trying to discover tools.

My preferred approach? Stick to the primary AI tools, mainly ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, to do the work that needs to be done. Besides, if everyone's trying to wrap ChatGPT, why not just get good at the OG?

The tools I recommend aren’t AI tools themselves, but they optimize how you work with AI. They help streamline iterations by improving feedback and communication, making the most of AI’s increased token limits and multimodal inputs.

Also, contrary to many AI experts out there, I don’t use ChatGPT in Playground mode. I don’t care to tweak any of the model parameters. My policy? Reduce barriers. Make it easy. Use the main functionality, and just make to actually use it when working.

With that said, here are the tools that optimize how you work with AI:

Clipboard manager with a copy/paste history. Game changer. To really use AI well, you’ll be copying and pasting things around, from one model to another or from your Slack to ChatGPT to an email or from a Google Doc to a Google Slide. It’s hard to do all that with only one slot for pasted content. This is like upgrading your RAM for work. There are a few tools that do this, and there are probably free ones. I am a proponent of investing for these tools, and for me personally I use Alfred for my clipboard manager.

Text snippet tool that stores a text shortcut which expands into larger text. This is great for having a computer-wide system of your go-to AI commands. This can be for frequent instructions you write out, context you add, or even corrections or feedback you find yourself making often. I use Alfred for this as well.

Screenshot tool. ChatGPT isn’t just for text—it’s multimodal, so you can use images to give instructions and directions. A good screenshot tool lets you annotate and quickly drop images into your chat with AI, speeding up clarity and feedback loops. I use Zight for this, as it offers a handy popup to drag screenshots directly into the chat without needing to open a folder. There are plenty of options, but I prefer Zight for its seamless workflow.

Bonus round: Get the official ChatGPT app for desktop. Use voice transcription. Learn the shortcut to pull it up mid-workflow. Get used to working side-by-side with AI. Make it easy to use and ask questions.

The key is to keep it simple and practice actually using AI in the work. So, ditch the endless lists of AI tools and fancy wrappers. Focus on practice, not perfection. You don't need to be a prompt engineer or a coding wizard - just a smart professional ready to work smarter, not harder.
